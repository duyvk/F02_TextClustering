read by goverment spokesman Theodore Holo] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Following the report presented 
by the minister of civil service and administrative reform on 
the ongoing negotiations with labor unions, in particular, 
concerning the two demands submitted by the unions to the 
government delegation, namely: 1. The coupling of promotions 
and an upward review of the cost of a living allowance and; 2. 
An increase in family allowances; the cabinet reaffirmed the 
government's position, which had already been communicated to 
union leaders on 15 March. First, the government intends to meet 
the above-mentioned two union demands within the limits of an 
increase in the wage bill, to the tune of 9,225,328,610 CFA 
francs. Second, the government will proceed with the necessary 
calculations for the breakdown and distribution of this wage 
bill, with the participation of union representatives designated 
by the unions themselves. The cabinet calls on all unions which 
are to participate in the calculations to get in touch with the 
paymaster general's office at the Ministry of Finance first 
thing tomorrow, 17 March. Moreover, the cabinet has decided to 
submit an enabling bill to the National Assembly as soon as 
possible to permit the government to pay immediately to workers 
those financial benefits accruing from the salary readjustment 
measures, and to hold payment of those relating to the payment 
of the actual [words indistinct] pending the passing of the 1994 
budget, in line with the provisions of Article 102 of our 
Constitution. [passage omitted]
