  [Text] Durban March 15 SAPA -- Roads were barricaded by 
rocks and burning tyres in Umlazi on Tuesday [15 March] to 
reinforce an African National Congress [ANC] march and stayaway 
to demand free political activity in the sprawling Durban 
township, police said. The Umlazi sub-region of the ANC planned 
a march at 10am to protest against the blockade of its rally at 
the King Zwelithini Stadium in the township at the weekend. 
  Thousands of Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters occupied 
the stadium on Sunday, preventing ANC supporters from entering 
to hold a rally. At least five people died in violence 
apparently linked to the confrontation. 
  Meanwhile, Umlazi's usually busy main roads were quiet on 
Tuesday morning with almost no vehicle movement in the area. 
  District kwaZulu police commissioner Brig Alwyn Burger 
described the township as "tense and almost lifeless". He 
reported several barricades on main roads and alleged there had 
been intimidation. "People feel threatened and they're staying 
at home." 
  But, Umlazi's ANC Secretary Thami Ndlela denied allegations 
of intimidation against his organisation. "It's not the policy 
of the ANC," he said. He added that the overwhelming majority of 
Umlazi's residents supported Tuesday's protest. 
  "We're expecting tens of thousands at our march. They are 
not 
only ANC supporters but people like church and businessmen who 
are very concerned at Sunday's events." He said a memorandum 
would be delivered to the local magistrate, demanding free 
political activity and noting the IFP's alleged contravention of 
the Electoral Act. 
  "We're also calling for the rapid deployment of the national 
peace keeping force here to replace the kwaZulu Police and 
Internal Stability Unit," Mr Ndlela said. 
  "We believe these forces are partial and they demonstrated 
this by not acting to remove the people from the stadium at the 
weekend."
