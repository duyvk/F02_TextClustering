To mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of Polish astronomer Nicolaus 
Copernicus in 1973, he designed a commemorative poster issued by a chapter of 
the Polish American Congress, another poster commissioned by the Museum of 
Science and Industry in Chicago and a commemorative bronze-cast plaque for the 
Griffith Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
To salute the 175th anniversary of the birth of Polish composer Frederic Chopin 
in 1985, he designed and personally issued a commemorative medal in silver and 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
To honor Pope John Paul II, he designed a commemorative medal issued by the 
Polish American Numismatic Assn. and painted a stunning oil portrait of the 
former Cardinal of Krakow that now hangs in the library at Loyola Marymount 
University in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And to do his part for the American Bicentennial, he designed and personally 
issued a commemorative medal featuring George Washington flanked by his fellow 
"freedom founders," the Polish-born Generals Thaddeus Kosciuszko and Casimir 
Pulaski. 
</P>
<P>
Given all that -- and that is just a sampler -- it would seem only a matter of 
time before Polish-born artist and designer Leon Kawecki of Garden Grove would 
get around to creating an artistic tribute to one of Poland's greatest 
actresses of all time: Madame Helena Modjeska, a Polish emigrant and pioneer 
Orange County resident who became the leading Shakespearean actress in the 
United States in the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned last year by the California chapter of the Polish-American 
Historical Assn., the limited-edition commemorative medal that Kawecki has 
designed captures both Modjeska the woman and her century-old house on her 
estate in Santiago Canyon, which the actress named Arden after the Forest of 
Arden in Shakespeare's "As You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
"In Poland, she is considered the greatest lady of the theater," said Kawecki, 
who retains a rich Polish accent even after 38 years in this country. "There 
was no one greater than Modjeska. In Poland, we say, 'Mode-ju-yev-ska."' 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish-American Historical Assn. plans to issue the high-relief, 2 
3/4-inch-diameter medal in April. (It will cost $35 in bronze, $230 in silver. 
For details, call the Polish-American Historical Assn. at (213) 670-1090.) 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the medal will help pay for the publication of an updated version 
of the nonprofit organization's 1977 book, "Polish-Americans in California and 
Who's Who." The new book will be dedicated to Modjeska. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a towering figure of the Polish community of our past," said chapter 
president Henrietta Simons, who has seen Kawecki's charcoal drawings for the 
medal and deems it "gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
"It is so striking," she said. "I like Leon's work, but I love this medal. He 
really, to me, captured her." 
</P>
<P>
The obverse side of the medal features a portrait of the actress with long, 
flowing hair. Using artistic license, Kawecki has her wearing a broad-brimmed, 
Western-style hat with an art nouveau diamond-shaped decoration on it that 
matches her earrings. The bottom of the medal is adorned with the coat-of-arms 
of Krakow, Modjeska's birthplace, which is flanked with laurel leaves. The 
circular legend reads: "Helena Modjeska -- First Lady of the Theater." 
</P>
<P>
The reverse side of the medal shows Modjeska's celebrated Orange County home 
surrounded by lush vegetation. In the distance are the twin peaks of Saddleback 
Mountain (Modjeska and Santiago), and in the center of the upper part is a 
stylized mask, symbol of the theater arts. The legend on top reads "Pioneer 
Actress of Two Continents -- Born in Krakow, Poland Oct. 12, 1840. Died at 
Balboa, California, April 8, 1909." And on the bottom: "Arden -- Modjeska's 
Home in Santiago Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge of designing a commemorative medal, according to Kawecki, is to 
convey an historically important event in a condensed space. A commemorative 
medal, he said, is art in miniature, "so therefore certain elements have to be 
exaggerated to bring out the beauty of the medal." 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with his nine other commemorative medals honoring Polish 
historical figures, Kawecki donated his time and work in designing the Modjeska 
medal for the Polish-American Historical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to donate something of my own to Modjeska," said Kawecki, a longtime 
association member. "It gives me a specific pleasure to produce a token of my 
own admiration for a Polish emigre who has contributed something not only to 
Poland but the world at large." 
</P>
<P>
To research the Polish actress and her home, Kawecki consulted with Modjeska 
historian Ellen K. Lee of Laguna Beach and viewed old photographs and 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
He did not, however, visit Modjeska's house, which is being restored by the 
county as part of a 14.5-acre historical park. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm ashamed," he confessed in a mock whisper, then boomed, "I'm so 
occupied, my friend! Every day I have something else." 
</P>
<P>
As Western region art director for Meade Packaging in Buena Park, Kawecki 
spends the workweek designing packages for 7-Up, Pepsi, RC Cola and various 
fruit juice and water companies. 
</P>
<P>
That, he said, is "my bread and butter. Everything else is just for my pleasure 
and for my ambition to release my creative energies." 
</P>
<P>
His Garden Grove apartment is testament to his considerable creative energies. 
</P>
<P>
The living room is a virtual art gallery, its walls filled with strikingly 
colorful oil paintings that he has executed in a variety of styles. The spare 
bedroom that serves as his studio is packed with examples of his medals, 
posters and some 20 commemorative envelopes he designed for philatelic 
societies to commemorate everything from the Berlin airlift and the American 
Bicentennial to the millennium of Christianity in Poland and the 100th 
anniversary of the death of Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki is now working on the design for a commemorative medal that will be 
presented to VIPs at a banquet at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel before the 54th 
annual Pulaski Parade in New York City next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Mind you," he noted while showing a visitor his work, "I do this in my spare 
time -- Saturdays, Sundays and evenings. I'm a very compulsive man." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Kawecki's creative time is spent pacing around his studio, or having a 
cup of coffee -- all as mental preparation for sitting down at his drawing 
table. 
</P>
<P>
For him, it's time spent "trying to embrace the spirit of the muse of the fine 
arts." And when he does embrace the muse, he exclaimed, "I embrace it as if it 
is ecstasy!" 
</P>
<P>
The son of fish and produce merchants, Kawecki has been embracing the muse 
since he was a boy growing up in Chojnice, a small Polish town near Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
At 8, he began studying with one of his parents' customers, a well-known German 
artist who ran a private art school in Kawecki's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
At 12, he entered an all-Poland scholastic competition, winning a top medal for 
his watercolor landscape featuring his town's centuries-old church. 
</P>
<P>
And at 14, he became the youngest student ever admitted to the Academy of Fine 
Arts in Poznan, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki's artistic ambitions, however, were derailed in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Having just completed a cross-country bicycle trip, he was about to begin his 
post-graduate studies at the art academy when Germany invaded Poland on Sept. 
1. Kawecki, along with other civilians fleeing the advancing German army, 
linked up with Polish Army troops on a road heading east toward the Russian 
border. "We felt the Russians were our saviors," he said. But on Sept. 17, the 
Russians invaded Poland and on the 23rd, Kawecki and other civilians were taken 
prisoner along with the soldiers. "No one in the West knew the Russians and 
Germans had signed a mutual military pact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After spending time in a succession of Russian prisoner-of-war camps, Kawecki 
was sent to a camp in Siberia. Noting that "everyone in such trying 
circumstances tries to make his existence as good as possible," he let it be 
known that he was an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"The Russians always admired the arts, be it music, literature or the fine 
arts, and they took me as their own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki was provided with office space and, using hospital linens for his 
canvases and paints obtained on the black market, he spent his days copying old 
Russian masters for the Russian officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Periodically, when we went from one camp to another, the Russians, of course, 
didn't know who I was and it took me a while to again get them to know I'm an 
artist," he recalled. "So I worked in brigades, a detachment of prisoners of 
war. There were about 12 people to a brigade, and they sent you to a factory 
here and there or into the forest to cut wood. I stayed with them for a while, 
until I got noticed again (as an artist)." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he also spoke Russian helped. "You have the immediate 
communication with your captor: You speak his language -- you reach his spirit, 
you see -- and it alleviates so much of the hostility." 
</P>
<P>
After Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941 and the Russians joined the 
Allies, Kawecki joined the Polish Army under British command. He served in 
campaigns in North Africa and Italy and was wounded three times. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, he returned home to Poland, but his stay was brief. "My family 
wasn't there anymore because they were afraid of the Russians," he said. "They 
went to Germany and Austria and France." 
</P>
<P>
He followed suit, living mostly in Germany and traveling extensively in Austria 
and Greece. He found jobs working in graphic arts and took whatever other jobs 
he could find. He also resumed his fine arts studies, a practice he continued 
after arriving in the United States in 1951. With a laugh, he said, "I was 
never done with school. The last school I had was 8 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving in the United States, Kawecki initially lived with a Polish 
family in Cleveland. Unable to get a job in the graphic arts, he took the first 
job he could find: a punch-press and brake-press operator for a 
steel-manufacturing company. Evenings he attended classes at John Huntington 
Polytechnic Institute. "I never worked as hard as my first years in America: I 
wanted to go to school, I wanted to accomplish so much." 
</P>
<P>
After a year, he moved to Pittsburgh, where he landed a job as a packaging 
designer for Fuller Label and Box Co. At night, he attended the Pittsburgh Art 
Institute and Carnegie Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki, who was married in 1953 and became an American citizen in 1956, landed 
his job at Meade Packaging in 1960. Despite his success in packaging design -- 
he has won two major international awards in his field -- the divorced father 
of four children never lost his desire to make a contribution in fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
"My ambition was always to be a recognized artist," he said. "In fact, on my 
application when I came to Meade Packaging it states: 'What is your ultimate 
goal?' And I wrote: 'It is to be a recognized artist.' " 
</P>
<P>
And so he is. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his paintings are in museums in Germany, Poland and the United States. 
And his Bicentennial commemorative medal, for one, is in more than 30 major 
collections, including the Smithsonian Institution Museum and the private 
collections of former Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki said his extracurricular artistic endeavors are not only motivated by 
his "love for the arts" but also, through his Polish themes, his desire to 
educate people about Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"The West is very poor at acknowledging, or even having the knowledge of, what 
contributions Poland has made in the world in the sciences, the arts and 
history in general," he said. "For instance, for the American Bicentennial, 
there were many books issued crediting many generals for the victories in 
different areas. However, there was not even mention in some of them of the 
great contributions of Kosciuszko and Pulaski, who were great heroes of many 
battles." 
</P>
<P>
Although he declines to say which medal is his favorite, he has a particular 
affinity for his medal commemorating the birth of Chopin, who also happens to 
be his favorite composer. "His music," he said, "has such great longing for 
Poland; he wakens up the sentiments and all the compassion for our motherland." 
</P>
<P>
In his own way, Kawecki expresses his own sentiments for the motherland. 
</P>
<P>
Through his art, he said, "I want to pay homage to the country of my birth."
