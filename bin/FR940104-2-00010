<ACTION>
ACTION: 
Notice of availability of an amendment to a fishery management plan; request for comments.
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 
NMFS issues this notice that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 32 to
the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) for Secretarial review and is requesting comments
from the public. There is no proposed rule accompanying this amendment. Therefore, this is the final opportunity
to comment on this amendment.
Copies of the amendment may be obtained from the Council (see 
ADDRESSES
).
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 
Comments on the FMP amendment should be submitted on or before March 7, 1994.
</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 
Comments on the FMP amendment should be submitted to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska
Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, Alaska 99802 (Attn: Lori Gravel), or delivered to the Federal Building, 709
West 9th Street, Juneau, Alaska.
Copies of Amendment 32 and the environmental assessment (EA) and economic analysis prepared for the amendment are
available from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, Alaska 99510 (telephone

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary,
upon receiving a fishery management plan or amendment, immediately publish a notice that the fishery management
plan or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received
during the comment period in determining public comments received during the comment period in determining whether
to approve the FMP or amendment.
Amendment 32 would establish a plan to rebuild stocks of the rockfish Pacific ocean perch (POP) (
Sebastes alutus
) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). POP is a highly valued groundfish. It was heavily exploited by a foreign trawl fleet from
the early 1960's until the mid-1980's. Thereafter, a domestic at-sea processing fleet harvested POP at a substantially
lower rate. Catches of POP peaked in 1965 when an estimated 350,000 metric tons (mt) were harvested by the foreign fleet;
catches declined sharply in the late 1960's. From 1961-1977, annual POP landings averaged over 40,000 mt; after
1977, landings averaged 6,000 mt. In the domestic fishery, POP was managed as part of a larger slope rockfish assemblage
of about 20 species until 1991, when POP was established as a separate target species category to prevent possible
overfishing.
As a result of increased concern about the status of POP stocks, biomass assessment methodology has been improved
and domestic harvest levels have been reduced. The 1993 total allowable catch (TAC) of 2,560 mt was available only
as incidental catch in other groundfish fisheries. In recent years POP has been managed as a single species, harvest
levels have been reduced, and directed fisheries have been restricted or eliminated. In spite of this conservative
management in recent years, POP biomass has increased only slightly and remains depressed from historic levels.
The current spawner biomass of about 71,000 mt is estimated to be 15-20 percent of the level observed during the
1960's.
The Council believes that increasing the biomass of POP to a level closer to historical amounts is necessary to achieve
optimum yield in the POP fishery. Factors other than fishing mortality contribute to the continued depressed state
of the POP resource. Ecosystem changes or other biological factors may preclude rebuilding success. Nevertheless,
the Council considers minimizing POP mortality necessary to maximize the probability of rebuilding success in a
realistic time period. Additionally, decreasing POP mortality should minimize resource waste associated with
low TACs that do not fully accommodate incidental catch needs of existing fisheries.
