It was thumbs up for pepperoni and cheese egg rolls, thumbs down for chicken 
tenders. 
</P>
<P>
On the Brian Bickhart scale of 1 to 5, the egg rolls clearly deserved the top 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
And the bite-size pieces of fried chicken called tenders? "They tasted gross," 
said the young gourmand with a grimace. 
</P>
<P>
Bickhart, 18, was one of hundreds of Cal Poly Pomona students who served as 
food critics Wednesday at the Los Olivos Food Fair. It was an opportunity for 
students to try new foods and to help choose what will be on future menus at 
the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
For the third year in a row, food suppliers were invited to set up booths at 
Los Olivos, the central dining room for 1,200 resident students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Items Will Be Added 
</P>
<P>
The students sampled and rated the various products. Their surveys will be 
reviewed by the college's food services department, and some items will be 
added to the regular menu. 
</P>
<P>
Previous student favorites added to cafeteria fare include knishes, egg rolls 
and praline ice cream. Also picked have been items for the health-conscious, 
such as bulgur wheat and sugar peas. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Los Olivos was filled with the aroma of chili mingled with a hint 
of stuffed shrimp and pizza. It was lunchtime gridlock as hungry students piled 
plates with food from the 30 vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Standing near a display of fruit pies and brownies, Food Services Director 
George Way said he got the idea for the food fair after reading about an East 
Coast college that held one. Among the 19 campuses in the California State 
University system, he said, Cal Poly Pomona is the only one that sponsors such 
an event. 
</P>
<P>
For Bickhart, an accounting major, the fair was an opportunity to help change 
the "cycle of food" he eats in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, if (normal cafeteria meals) look bad, we just go for cereal. 
That's neutral," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Platefuls 
</P>
<P>
"Today is like Thanksgiving," said Mark Lipin, 20. He had devoured three plates 
of food, with no signs of slowing down, and gave high marks to the chimichangas 
and chili. 
</P>
<P>
Some students carried 2-foot loaves of French bread under their arms. Others 
politely asked for strawberries and were given an entire pint container. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students interviewed preferred spicy ethnic foods, fresh fruit and 
pastries. Over the years, Way said, he has seen an increase in requests for 
fresh seafood and vegetarian and ethnic entrees as students have grown more 
nutritionally conscious. 
</P>
<P>
Student appetites are ferocious, observed Dennis Livingstone of Rudy's Farm, a 
food manufacturer. His booth served 360 sausage- and-biscuit sandwiches, many 
of them second helpings. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to college here, but they never had anything like this," said Jane De 
Bie, a representative from Atlas Horn. She served 600 fruit-juice spritzer 
samples and dozens of muffins and bagels. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of students lined up at the Bentley's Produce display, where wooden 
crates brimmed with flowers, fruits and vegetables. The chocolate-covered 
strawberries went quickly, Bill Bentley said as he opened another crate of 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Quantities 
</P>
<P>
Starving students are no surprise to Way. "For one lunch, we'll use 1,600 
hamburgers and 130 pounds of fries," he said. The dining hall serves an average 
of 3,000 meals a day. In a year, he said, students consume 17,000 gallons of 
milk, 12,500 hot dogs and 35,000 dozen eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Way, a food industry veteran for 30 years, said he always gets requests for 
lobster tails and filet mignon, but those items would break his budget. 
Students get three all-you-can-eat meals for about $7.40 per day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking some pastries back to our room," said Sherrie Chung, 18, stuffing 
her book bag with some extra muffins, pastries and a juice spritzer. 
</P>
<P>
Chung's roommate, Julie Deal, 18, balanced two paper plates covered with 
cheesecake slices and muffins in one hand. In her other hand was a half-eaten 
ice cream sample. "Thank goodness we have a big refrigerator," she said.
