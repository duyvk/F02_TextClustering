Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have for the first 
time inserted a human cancer gene into a mouse to produce a specific type of 
human cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Their research, 
reported last week in Science, demonstrates that the gene does, in fact, cause 
the disease in humans and opens the way for testing of new therapies.

CML affects 10,000 Americans each year. Patients usually respond well to 
chemotherapy for three to five years, then experience a sudden increase in 
abnormal cells, signaling the onset of acute disease. The only therapy for the 
acute stage is bone marrow transplants.

CML was the first cancer associated with a specific abnormality in chromosomes, 
the repository of genetic information. Researchers at the University of 
Pennsylvania reported in the 1960s that, in all victims of the disease, a small 
portion of chromosome 9 had become fused to a piece of chromosome 22, forming a 
characteristic chromosome called the Philadelphia chromosome.

Researchers subsequently found that a new gene is formed from sections of two 
normal genes when the Philadelphia chromosome is formed during development. 
Molecular biologist David Baltimore and his colleagues at MIT inserted ths gene 
into mice to produce CML in the animals.
