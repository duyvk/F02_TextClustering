Organized labor vehemently declared its opposition on Wednesday to Gov. George 
Deukmejian's plan to require prison convicts to help pay for their keep by 
working, contending that the proposal would create "a captive labor force 
surrounded by armed guards." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, a major legislative initiative announced by Deukmejian in his State 
of the State speech in January, flew into a wall of opposition from labor at a 
hearing of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee. 
</P>
<P>
It was defended by top-level Administration officials, including James A. 
Rowland, director of corrections, who insisted to the committee that "we don't 
want to displace one law-abiding worker" by putting prisoners to work in 
privately operated enterprises at prison sites. 
</P>
<P>
From a prisoner's presumed minimum wage earnings, 20% would be withheld to help 
pay the room and board, 15% would be deducted for restitution to victims and 
40% would be taken for a mandatory savings program. Inmates could spend the 
remaining 25% as they wished. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Henning, the crusty veteran executive secretary-treasurer of the 
California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, denounced the proposal as a "turning back 
of the clock of history" that would be seized upon as "the ideal for the 
employer who wants to exploit." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a captive labor force surrounded by armed guards," he boomed out in the 
deep baritone voice of an old-fashioned union organizer. "It is turning back 
the clock of history to foist this on prisoners . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The California Constitution has long prohibited the use of state prisoners to 
perform work for private employers. Many attempts to repeal the prohibition 
have been killed by organized labor, which fears, among other things, that 
prisoners would displace civilian workers. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has proposed that 7,000 inmates, the same number now enrolled in 
prison industry work programs, participate in his program. He has said it would 
help ease the budget crunch and allow taxpayer dollars to be spent for services 
other than prisons. 
</P>
<P>
The governor also has indicated that if the proposal does not receive the 
required two-thirds favorable vote of the Democratic-dominated Legislature, he 
may sponsor a ballot initiative in 1990 seeking to implement the program. 
</P>
<P>
Henning warned Wednesday that "bureaucrats" could be counted upon to vastly 
expand the working convict program. "They (the bureaucrats) are willing to lick 
the paint off the walls of San Quentin to get this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he favors expansion of labor-endorsed work programs that enroll 222 
apprentices for skilled crafts and the prison industries program that involves 
7,000 participants. These programs operate under many restrictions designed to 
keep them from doing jobs that otherwise might be done by civilian labor. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by committee chairman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) if labor would be 
prepared to compromise on Deukmejian's proposal, Henning shot back: "Not on 
convict labor." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Bill Baker (R-Danville), legislative author of Deukmejian's 
proposed constitutional amendment, and others noted, however, that 60,000 
convicts a year are being released from crowded California prisons, whose 
population is expected to soar from 72,927 last year to 110,230 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He and officials of the Department of Corrections said these released convicts 
must be provided with "meaningful" jobs or they are almost certain to commit 
more crimes and return to prison at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
Under the project, modeled after a program for California Youth Authority 
offenders, private businesses would acquire space at prison sites and employ 
adult convicts to make products that could be sold on the open market. 
Currently, such prison-made items as furniture can be sold only to government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was told by an optical laboratory operator and a sheet metal 
contractor that goods manufactured by the Youth Authority inmates in its "free 
venture" work program have undercut their businesses.
