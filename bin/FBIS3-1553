  [Text] Tianjin, February 26 (XINHUA) -- The development of 
China will exert great influence on that of Asia and the world 
at large, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore senior minister said here 
today. 
  He told local journalists that he was confident of the 
future 
of China's long-term development. 
  Lee also expressed optimism on the prospect of 
Sino-Singapore 
ties, saying that great potential exists in bilateral 
cooperation since the economy of the two countries is 
mutually-complementary. 
  He said that since Singapore is short of land, and the labor 
costs are very high, it needs to export its capital, technology 
and management expertise. 
  Thus, Lee added, to develop friendly cooperation with 
foreign 
countries, including China, is part of Singapore's overall 
strategy. 
  Lee and his party arrived here on Thursday [24 February]. 
  Yesterday, Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin, gave Lee a brief 
introduction to the development of this largest industrial city 
in north China. 
  Lee also visited Tianjin's technology development zone and 
Tianjian port.
