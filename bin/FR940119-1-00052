NMFS believes it is possible to conduct directed fishing on species other than bluefin, with only a limited amount
of bluefin bycatch. However, if evidence indicates this is not true, NMFS may consider more stringent measures, such
as area or season closures or gear restrictions, in future rulemaking. 
Adjust the Longline Incidental Catch Boundary Line 
NMFS proposes to move the 36
&cir;N. latitude line that separates the northern and southern longline fisheries to 34
&cir;N. latitude. Several comments were received requesting such a change. A traditional longline fishing area
off Cape Hatteras straddles the current line at 36
&cir;N. latitude. The current boundary, which is a very dynamic oceanographic regime, creates a problem because
of the uncertainty of drifts in the cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies and currents that occur in the area. Fishermen
may take bluefin in an open area and drift to a closed area, whereupon they are not able to land these fish because of the
prohibition on capture, retention, possession, and offloading of bluefin when an area is closed to fishing. NMFS
believes adjustment of the boundary line to 34
&cir;N. latitude is appropriate because this a less dynamic oceanographic environment close to shore with the Florida
Current located further offshore. This modification should reduce waste of fish and enforcement problems in this
area without increasing bluefin mortality. The total bluefin quotas for the northern and southern management areas
for incidental longline catch would remain unchanged by this adjustment. 
Request for Comments Regarding the Use of Curved Length Measurements of Bluefin 
NMFS proposes to amend the regulations to include definitions of straight fork length, and curved fork length and
to clarify that straight length is the sole criterion for determination of bluefin tuna size class. Additionally,
NMFS proposes to amend the regulatory text regarding dealer reporting to clarify the existing requirements to report
weights and lengths of bluefin tuna purchased from fishermen. 
Currently, the size classes for bluefin are based on straight lengths (lengths taken along a straight line between
lines perpendicular to the body). If proper equipment is used, straight length provides a more accurate measurement
for bluefin than curved length (lengths taken along the curvature of the body) because of short-term variations in
the girth of the fish as a result of recent feeding rates. Frequently, however, calipers or similar instruments are
not available for measuring the straight length of bluefin. Measurements are often reported as curved length taken
with a tape measure held along the body of the fish. Illegal fish may be retained when commercial fishermen and recreational
anglers use curved length instead of straight length for determination of size classes and enforcement actions have
resulted. 
NMFS is not proposing to define size classes in terms of curved length at this time. However, after analysis of length
data is completed, NMFS could amend the size-class definitions to make curved length an acceptable criterion for
determination of bluefin tuna size class. NMFS requests comments on the use of curved length in conjunction with,
or in place of, straight length for determining size classes of bluefin. 
Request for Comments Regarding Additional Means To Provide Notice of Fishery Closures 
Under current regulations, closures are announced via notice in the 
Federal Register
, with the closures generally effective some time after filing the notice. Fishermen who do not have access to these
notices may consult NMFS weekly catch reports, consult notices issued over the highly migratory species fax network,
listen for updates on NOAA weather radio, or call 301-713-2347 or 508-281-9260 for current
information. NMFS received comments during the 1993 fishing season that sufficient notice was not provided for all
closures. While existing regulations do not require advance notice of closure, NMFS recognizes the importance of
making every effort to notify the affected public as far in advance as possible. 
Although NMFS endeavors to provide advance notice, quota monitoring is difficult when allowable catch levels are
small relative to the level of fishing effort. Based on current and historical catch rates, NMFS attempts to project
when quotas are likely to be reached for all fishing categories. While the overriding concern is to maintain catch
within each category's quota, it is also important that NMFS afford the maximum economic benefits to be gained from
full use of allocated quotas. Unfortunately, reliance on projected catch figures may result in premature closures
or short notification periods. Given the increasingly restrictive bluefin quotas in years 1995 and beyond, NMFS
anticipates that quota monitoring and notification of closures will become even more difficult. NMFS requests comments
on alternative means to provide notice of closures so as to minimize disruption to fishing activities and allow participants
to plan accordingly.
