FT  08 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: City salaries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that arbitrageurs are managing to collect million-pound salaries
once more caused a predictable kerfuffle among the excitable classes. It
will doubtless encourage those members of the worshipful company of
arbitrageurs who are still anonymous to keep their heads down from now on.
City salaries are high compared with other occupations. This is in part
because although the fees charged are small in relation to the quantity of
funds handled, they are large in relation to the small groups of
professionals required to handle the transactions. Individuals are also
often in a strong bargaining position since they can readily identify their
apparent contribution to profitability.
Yet the variance with other occupations is so great that there remains a
suspicion that institutions are mis-pricing even the most arcane skills
which they are buying. Part of that deviation may arise because the apparent
profitability is not properly costed to take into account the full support
functions.
Some of the particularly highly-paid individuals have relationships with
their employers which more closely resemble joint equity ventures. In bad
years, however, they do not cover a proportion of the losses. Mr Peter Wood
of Direct Line, by contrast, actually sold an equity interest in a business
to Royal Bank of Scotland in return for his service contract. Significantly,
even before the latest rumours concerning the flotation of Direct line, he
had been considering exchanging his large employee bonus for an equity
interest in RBS.
