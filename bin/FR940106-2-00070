We are unable to identify the effects of these provisions on individual SNFs. However, we anticipate that overall
SNF payments for FY 1994 and FY 1995 will be approximately 1.2 percent and 2.3 percent less, respectively, than they
would have been in those years if the OBRA '93 provisions were not in effect. Moreover, since Medicare does not account
for a high proportion of SNF utilization or revenue, we estimate that the delay in updating the limits and the elimination
of the hospital-based add-on will not result in a significant number of facilities' total revenues being increased
or reduced by 3 percent or more from the October 7, 1992 limits, adjusted for inflation. Thus, we have determined that
the economic impact on SNFs will not be significant. 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final notice such as
this may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 100 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
We have not prepared a rural impact statement since we have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final
notice will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.
IV. Other Required Information 
A. Paperwork Reduction Act 
This final notice with comment period does not impose information collection requirements. Consequently, it need
not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44
U.S.C. 3501 through 3511). 
B. Waiver of Proposed Notice and 30-Day Delay in the Effective Date 
In adopting notices such as this, we ordinarily publish a proposed notice in the 
Federal Register
 with a 60-day period for public comment as required under section 1871(b)(1) of the Act. We also normally provide a
delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, we may waive these procedures if we find good
cause that prior notice and comment or a delay in the effective date are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to
the public interest. 
As discussed above, before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(a) of the Act required that the SNF routine cost
limits be updated for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1992 and every 2 years thereafter. However,
section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 specifies that there be no changes in the SNF cost limits for cost reporting periods
beginning during FYs 1994 and 1995, and section 13503(a)(2) of OBRA '93 amended section 1888 of the Act to delay the
next required update of the SNF limits until October 1, 1995. In addition, section 13503(a)(3) of OBRA '93 amended
section 1888(b) of the Act to eliminate, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993,
the add-on to the SNF cost limits to recognize the higher administrative and general costs of hospital-based SNFs.
In conformance with the clear direction of section 13503(a) of OBRA '93, this notice announces the new SNF provisions
and explains the effects of these provisions on the methodology used in calculating the SNF cost limits. We have made
no changes in this methodology beyond those directly required by OBRA '93, nor are there any other discretionary aspects
to this notice. Moreover, section 13503(a) of OBRA '93 mandates that these provisions are effective beginning with
cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. Thus, we have concluded that in this instance, it would
be impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to publish a proposed notice or to provide for
a 30-day delay in the effective date of this notice. Therefore, we find good cause to waive publication of a proposed
notice and the 30-day delay in effective date. However, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated
at the beginning of this preamble. 
C. Public Comments 
Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive, we are not able to acknowledge or respond
to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the "Date"
section of the preamble to this notice. If we make any changes to this notice, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to the notice that incorporates the changes.
