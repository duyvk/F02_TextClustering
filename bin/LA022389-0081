There's nothing quite like watching the birth of a new technology and figuring 
out what wonderful things you'll be able to do with it. When photography was 
invented in 1839 -- by a Frenchman and an Englishman working independently, as 
so often happened in the history of science -- it offered the chance to see the 
world with new eyes, in great and small detail. 
</P>
<P>
"Experimental Photography: Discovery and Invention," at the J. Paul Getty 
Museum (to April 2) gives viewers a taste of the strangeness of this new 
medium, and the hits and misses that occurred when people tried it out. The 
first in a yearlong series commemorating the 150th anniversary of photography, 
the exhibit also offers a crash course in the differences among the early 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The daguerreotype process, invented by Joseph-Nicephore Niepce (and named after 
his death by his partner, architectural draftsman Louis-Jacques-Mande 
Daguerre), created a single, highly detailed image on a silver-plated sheet of 
copper. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, William Henry Fox Talbot had figured out how to make what he called 
"photogenic drawings" by placing objects on paper treated with light-sensitive 
silver salts and exposing it to sunlight. As quietly awesome as a holy relic 
brought back by a pilgrim, the tiny, dark, irregularly shaped image of a corner 
of flowered linen cloth that Talbot made (probably in 1835) is one of the very 
first images of the world made on paper without the use of ink or paint. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't pursue this discovery -- or announce it to the world -- until 
1839, when the daguerreotype was officially unveiled in Paris before a huge 
crowd of scientists, artists and the curious public. 
</P>
<P>
Jolted into action by the competition, he got back to work and invented the 
calotype, which made it possible to produce paper negatives more swiftly, 
thanks to a battery of chemicals. Meanwhile, astronomer Sir John Herschel was 
devising the cyanotype process, which used iron salts to create blue 
photographs from paper negatives made without a camera. Unlike the 
daguerreotype -- passe by midcentury -- these processes allowed for multiple 
copies of the same image. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few years, a number of men and women with scientific or 
artistic backgrounds, lots of patience and access to the special formulas and 
ingredients looked around for outdoor (i.e., sufficiently well-lit) subjects to 
photograph. Lace, botanical specimens, neighborhood views and interesting local 
characters were early favorites in this era of naive and enthusiastic 
experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
A scrap of handmade lace in a photogenic drawing negative by Talbot looks 
almost like a living organism seen under a microscope: a network of minute 
holes with almost imperceptible differences in shape -- a miraculous design 
rendered strikingly complex in the places where two layers of lace accidentally 
double up. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Atkins -- a serious amateur botanist whose father, a curator of natural 
history at the British Museum, was a friend of Herschel -- assembled an 
ambitious cyanotype catalogue of underwater plants, each rendered as a flat 
white design on a blue background. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot's early triumphs also included a delicately detailed image of an oak 
tree and a view from the window of a hotel in which the photographer 
serendipitously caught a sliver of light on the shutter of a building across 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
Scotsmen Robert Adamson, who ran a calotype studio, and David Octavius Hill, a 
landscape painter, teamed together to produce calotype portraits and tableaux, 
some curiously undisciplined (a group of lounging Newhaven fisherman, some 
indifferently turning their backs to the photographers), some painstakingly 
posed in the fashion of Victorian paintings (three women unconvincingly making 
a show of great interest in a letter). 
</P>
<P>
Hippolyte Bayard, a French civil servant, chose his stocky self as a major 
subject, photographed amid carefully arranged groupings of everyday objects 
which, says exhibit curator Weston Naef, contain symbolic meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Stymied at not being able to shoot indoors, Bayard tried setting up a table and 
chairs outdoors so two women could pretend to be busy with their needlework as 
if ensconced as usual in their parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Bayard was also on hand to register the way the Rue Royale and Place de la 
Concorde looked after the 1848 uprising in Paris that overthrew the 
constitutional monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The next wave of photographic maturity would bring Roger Fenton's battlefield 
scenes of the Crimean War, Carlton Watkins' views of Yosemite and Julia 
Margaret Cameron's dreamy literary tableaux -- all to be unveiled at the Getty 
April 11 in "Experimental Photography: The First Golden Age."
