WEAKNESS in the Japanese economy will depress average growth among the
world's leading industrialised economies to 2.2 per cent next year, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast yesterday,
David Buchan reports from Paris.
After a two-day meeting of its economic policy committee, Mr Kumi Shigehara,
OECD chief economist, said growth estimates of real gross domestic product
were being revised downwards from 1.2 to 1.1 per cent for this year and from
2.7 to 2.2 per cent next year. While European members could expect an
average 1.5 per cent next year, Japan's growth 'could be well below 1 per
cent'. Ms Laura Tyson, head of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic
Advisers, said the US was on course in the second half of this year and in
1994 for a 3 per cent annual growth rate.
The discussion on monetary policy had concluded that the macroeconomic
benefit of interest rate cuts in the US, Canada, UK and Australia had been
delayed or reduced because of 'build-up of debt positions in the business,
household and banking sectors'.
By contrast, many countries in continental Europe did not face such balance
sheet adjustments. 'Here, monetary easing may have a more rapid effect on
activity'. But several continental European countries had indicated that
their concerns about currency and price stability prevented them cutting
interest rates.
