U.S. SECRECY KEEPS CLOUD OF DOUBT OVER MENGELE DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly four years after remains unearthed from a Brazilian cemetery were 
identified as those of Dr. Josef Mengele, the notorious Auschwitz death camp 
doctor, the U.S. government refuses to close its books and make public its 
final report on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations has rejected requests 
by a Holocaust survivors group and by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles to release the lengthy report under the federal Freedom of Information 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Wiesenthal Center, who 
believes the remains are those of Mengele. "Keeping the report a secret 
perpetuates a conspiracy theory." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, fueled in part by government secrecy, theories persist that Mengele may 
still be alive. 
</P>
<P>
Those who subscribe to this view say the bones dug up from a cemetery near Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, in 1985 and examined by six renowned forensic experts were not 
those of Mengele after all, but were part of an elaborate hoax. 
</P>
<P>
The experts, however, insist that the evidence is clear: Mengele died in 1979 
and those are his bones. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who dispute the experts are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who once agreed with the experts but who now 
says, "I see the whole matter of Mengele in absolutely another light. . . . It 
was too perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Menachem Russek, chief Nazi war crimes investigator for the Israeli 
government, who reportedly has written a 60-page memorandum contending that the 
experts who examined the remains were misled by a sophisticated 
sleight-of-hand. Like the United States, the Israeli government has kept its 
casebook on Mengele open and has refused to make its report public. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesenthal, in public, and Russek, in private, point to a meeting that is said 
to have taken place in Bavaria in 1982 at the home of Dr. Hans Munch, a Mengele 
associate at Auschwitz. Present were Mengele's longtime friend and courier, 
Hans Sedlmeier, and a Mengele nephew, Dieter Mengele. 
</P>
<P>
At the gathering -- which occurred three years after Mengele's family said he 
had died -- Sedlmeier asked Munch what would happen if Mengele turned himself 
in to authorities, according to an intelligence source account of the meeting 
provided to the United States, Israel and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"That does not fit into the logical conclusions" about Mengele's reported 
death, said Hans-Eberhard Klein, who heads the Bonn government's investigation 
of the case. Klein said Munch and Sedlmeier were questioned about the meeting, 
but he declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, however, is eager to resolve the matter. In a telephone interview 
from his Frankfurt office, Klein told The Times that he has invited Russek and 
Neal Sher, head of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, 
to meet with him in Frankfurt the week of March 20 in an effort to sort out the 
Mengele controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Klein also disclosed that he is considering trying to use a new DNA genetic 
"fingerprinting" test to determine if the skeleton is Mengele's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sample of Cells 
</P>
<P>
The new technique relies on the fact that everyone's DNA (deoxyribonucleic 
acid), the biologic makeup of genes, is unique. To make a "fingerprint," 
scientists take a sample of cells from an organism -- a single hair or a bone 
-- and then extract the DNA for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Klein talked of taking "bones, parts of teeth or hair roots," taken from the 
remains disinterred in Brazil and now in the hands of German forensic experts, 
and analyzing them with a view toward determining if genetic tests can be 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he has "no great doubt" that Mengele is dead, Klein said that 
if Simon Wiesenthal and the Israelis "have serious doubts, then I will 
investigate them." 
</P>
<P>
The OSI's Sher, who also believes that Mengele died in Brazil, declined to 
discuss in any detail why he will not close the case and make public his 
report, except to suggest that diplomatic considerations are among his reasons. 
He would not elaborate. In the meantime, the ghost of Josef Mengele, the 
infamous "Angel of Death," lives on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Born in Bavaria 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1911 in the small Bavarian community of Gunzburg, Mengele was the 
eldest of three sons of Karl and Walburga Mengele. His father prospered in the 
farm machinery business and, today, Karl Mengele &amp; Sons is the town's 
primary employer and one of West Germany's largest firms. 
</P>
<P>
After studying philosophy at Munich University, Mengele went to Frankfurt where 
he studied medicine. Attracted to Adolf Hitler's racial purity theories, he 
joined the Nazi party and, at 22, was on the staff of the Institute of 
Hereditary Biology and Race Research. 
</P>
<P>
According to the records of the Wiesenthal Center, in 1939 Mengele joined the 
Waffen SS, the military arm of the Schutzstaffel, which had been formed as 
Hitler's personal bodyguard. In 1943, he was promoted to captain and appointed 
chief medical officer at the Auschwitz prisoner camp in southern Poland. 
</P>
<P>
By any historical measure, Auschwitz was a ghastly killing ground. Although 
exact numbers will never be available, about 4 million men, women and children 
-- the vast majority Jews -- were systematically exterminated at the camp 
through gassing, shooting, lethal injections and disease. Piles of corpses were 
burned daily in the camp's crematoria. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mengele, according to survivor accounts, who often met the cattle 
car-like trains filled with prisoners. Standing at attention and immaculately 
dressed in his SS uniform, he would wait on Auschwitz's train ramp as the cars 
unloaded and, with a flick of his index finger to the right or left, determined 
who would live and who would die. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twins a Passion 
</P>
<P>
Twins, however, were another matter -- and Mengele's passion. Survivors recall 
him yelling, "Zwillinge, zwillinge" ("twins, twins"), as he sought to cull 
young twins from their mothers. It was on these twins that Mengele performed 
some of his most horrific experiments in the name of genetic engineering in his 
quest to produce a super Aryan race. 
</P>
<P>
In the prison camp's archives, there are accounts of children being strapped to 
operating tables while Mengele probed their inner organs, injected their bodies 
with chemicals and pierced their eyes with dyes in an attempt to change their 
color. Survivors recall times when he treated them kindly, as if they were his 
own children, but they say there was no telling when he would execute a twin on 
the spot with the same emotion as swatting a fly. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, he was briefly in American hands but was released, a subject 
that reportedly takes up part of the still-secret U.S. report. Mengele's 
postwar odyssey ultimately took him to several South American countries, 
including Argentina, Paraguay and, finally, Brazil. It was in the Sao Paulo 
area, where, for about 25 years, he lived under an assumed name in the secret 
care of two European-born couples -- Wolfram and Liselotte Bossert and Gitta 
and Geza Stammer. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, Mengele's memory burned only in the minds of death camp survivors and 
a handful of Nazi-hunters. But on Jan. 27 of that year, he was suddenly thrust 
into prominence as Auschwitz's survivors roamed the camp's frozen, wind-swept 
ground, marking the 40th anniversary of its liberation by the Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
As the still-standing wooden watch towers, the red-brick barracks, the 
underground torture cells, the gas chambers and the crematoria came into view 
on television screens around the world, a crescendo of public opinion demanded: 
"Where is Mengele? Why hasn't he been arrested?" 
</P>
<P>
The following month, U.S. Atty. Gen. William French Smith ordered the Justice 
Department to make a determined effort to find Mengele. Leading the search was 
Sher's Office of Special Investigations. The bounty for capturing Mengele 
jumped to several million dollars with new reward money offered by West 
Germany, Israel and private donors, such as the Wiesenthal Center. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on May 31, 1985, a surprise raid by West German police on the Gunzburg 
home of Hans Sedlmeier uncovered letters and documents leading authorities to 
the Bosserts and the Stammers in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The Bosserts led Brazilian police to Grave 321 at the Embu Cemetery near Sao 
Paulo, declaring that Mengele had drowned at a nearby beach on Feb. 7, 1979. To 
cover his identity, investigators were told, Mengele had been buried under the 
name of Wolfgang Gerhard, a Nazi who had befriended him and who died in Austria 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
U.S., Brazilian and West German experts proceeded to authenticate the skeleton 
along with photographs and handwriting samples found at Mengele's Brazilian 
hideaways. The chain of evidence, in their opinion, was complete. In a June, 6, 
1985, report, they declared: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The exhumed remains are definitely not those of Wolfgang Gerhard. It is 
further our opinion that this skeleton is that of Josef Mengele within a 
reasonable scientific certainty." 
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by three consultants hired by the Justice Department: 
Ali Z. Hameli, chief medical examiner for the state of Delaware; Ellis R. 
Kerley, now-retired anthropology professor at the University of Maryland, and 
Dr. Lowell J. Levine, forensic odontology consultant for the New York State 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
Also signing were three experts hired by the Wiesenthal Center: Dr. John J. 
Fitzpatrick, chairman of the radiology division at Cook County Hospital in 
Chicago; Dr. Leslie Lukash, chief medical examiner of Nassau County, N.Y.; and 
Clyde Collins Snow, forensic anthropology consultant to the Oklahoma state 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews with The Times, all six said they were as sure today as 
they were in June, 1985, when they told journalists that the skeleton was 
Mengele's. 
</P>
<P>
"Scientifically," Hameli said, "it couldn't have been" a hoax. "As far as I am 
concerned, Mengele is dead." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, all six expressed surprise when informed that the Justice Department 
had not closed the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me," Snow said, "unless there's something new, it's time for 
someone to come to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Among their decisive points in identifying Mengele was a photographic 
comparison in which pictures of the exhumed skull were matched on a video 
terminal to known photos of Mengele from his Nazi SS file, compiled in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Also matched was a comparison by West German experts of features of Mengele's 
SS photos and what was believed to be Mengele's picture on a 1956 passport 
application in Argentina and a picture Wolfram Bossert had taken of the man who 
lived in his house between 1975 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a 30-page report on the skeletal remains underscored that 
although 29 bones were missing (the normal human skeleton has 206 bones), there 
were still too many similarities to Mengele's physical characteristics for the 
remains to be someone else's. 
</P>
<P>
For example, according to the report, Mengele's records showed that he stood 
5-feet 8 1/2-inches tall, or 174 centimeters, when measured in October, 1938. 
Height calculations from the skeleton performed by Snow and Kerley ranged 
between 167.5 centimeters to 179.4 centimeters, with an estimate of 173.5 
centimeters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determination of Age 
</P>
<P>
A bone analysis to determine age, conducted by Kerley, resulted in "a 86.7% 
probability that the age of this individual at death was between 64.25 and 
74.25 years and that the most probable age at death was 69.25 years," according 
to a copy of the report in the Wiesenthal Center archives. When he reportedly 
drowned, Mengele would have been nearly 68. 
</P>
<P>
Examination of the skull, which had only 10 remaining teeth, showed that the 
dead man had a wide gap between his upper front teeth before their removal -- 
similar to a gap that was shown clearly in a 1938 SS photo of a smiling 
Mengele. 
</P>
<P>
For OSI's Sher, though, there was still ground to be covered. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the Embu Cemetery findings, he told a congressional panel that 
based on the experts' conclusions, "I am convinced" the remains are Mengele's. 
But, privately, he knew there were doubts -- especially in Israel, a nation 
with a substantial population of death camp survivors who had an emotional 
stake in the Mengele case. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Sher said, he believed that if Mengele's dental X-rays could 
somehow be recovered, they would be as good as fingerprints and would be final 
proof that the Embu remains were indeed those of the death camp doctor. 
</P>
<P>
As forensic odontology consultant Levine recalled, the problem was that "the SS 
dental record was not sufficiently specific to allow positive identification" 
of the remains. "It just showed what teeth were filled" and contained no 
X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomat's Investigation 
</P>
<P>
That is when Stephen Dachi, the U.S. consul general in Sao Paulo in 1985 and a 
dental expert in his own right, came into the picture. After the experts had 
packed their bags and left Sao Paulo, Sher turned to Dachi and asked him to 
further investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, in what was purported to be one of Mengele's diaries, Dachi 
discovered that the writer had told of receiving root canal and upper molar 
work by a Brazilian dentist in a town next to Sao Paulo in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery excited Dachi because handwriting experts had already 
authenticated the Mengele diary notes. Ultimately, Dachi said, "that was the 
key to the whole question" -- the vital link to the X-rays. "We were 100% sure 
the writing in the diary was Mengele's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with this information, Dachi located the Brazilian dentist, who had a 
dental chart belonging to a Pedro Hochbichler, a Mengele alias. Hochbichler had 
been referred to a nearby dentist and his X-rays turned up in that dentist's 
files. 
</P>
<P>
Odontology consultant Levine, in a telephone interview from his office in New 
York State Police headquarters in Albany, said the X-rays "matched up 
perfectly" with dental X-rays he had taken of the skull found at Embu. "They 
matched up with the person named Wolfgang Gerhard," the name under which 
Mengele had been buried, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the remains exhumed at Embu were part of a hoax, Levine concluded, a Mengele 
"clone" was in the grave. 
</P>
<P>
But troubling the critics -- and evidently irksome to Sher -- are other events 
linked to Mengele's medical history. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Sher sent a Smithsonian Institution anthropologist, Donald J. Ortner, 
to Brazil to examine the exhumed remains for evidence of osteomyelitis, a bone 
disease from which Mengele suffered as a teen-ager, according to Waffen SS 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Because there was no antibiotic to combat the disease at that time, Ortner knew 
that osteomyelitis could leave bone scars. But Ortner could not find an obvious 
trace of the infection. "The clear evidence wasn't there," he recently 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Until this day, the Mengele family of Gunzburg has never asked Brazil for the 
remains, only serving to further fuel suspicions of the skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group of Survivors 
</P>
<P>
One of these doubters, Eva Mozes Kor, of Terre Haute, Ind., an Auschwitz 
survivor who, as a twin, was one of Mengele's guinea pigs, has devoted much of 
her life to searching for the Auschwitz doctor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Kor formed a group called CANDLES -- Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly 
Lab Experiments Survivors -- consisting of twins who had been Mengele's 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking OSI's final 
Mengele report. Last fall, the Justice Department responded: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Report Issued 
</P>
<P>
"To date, the United States has not issued a forensic report which either 
accepts or rejects the premise that the body located in Brazil was that of 
Mengele. . . . The Department has reached no final determination with respect 
to Mengele. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Simon Wiesenthal says he has information about "a new possible 
man in a South American country. They say this is Mengele." He would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The OSI's Sher said he is proud of the way his office conducted itself during 
the Mengele hunt. "This office has earned a reputation all over the world as 
being professional and aggressive in pursuing Nazis," he said. "There's no 
person more eager to get his hands on a live Josef Mengele than me." 
</P>
<P>
But given the preponderance of evidence declaring that Mengele is dead, he 
said, "I don't think it's fair to survivors . . . to inflict on them false 
hope. . . . That would be cruel." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Wiesenthal's new hoax theory, Rabbi Hier said he respects the 
Nazi-hunter's position -- but firmly believes that he is wrong. "Simon is very 
much his own man," Hier said. "He's been that way for 45 years." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing has changed, Hier underscored in an interview. "There has not been 
developed a single solid lead since the reported death (of Mengele) by any 
authority in the world," he said. "I think that would be the most decisive 
reason to conclude (the case)." 
</P>
<P>
As for the position of some death camp survivors who contend that the wool was 
artfully pulled over the world's eyes, Hier said: 
</P>
<P>
"I find it difficult to accept what CANDLES is saying. . . . (But) maybe they 
are entitled to that hope. They live with these dreams. Mengele is alive in 
them. The Mengele who appears every night in their dreams, he has become a 
living person even if the scientists tell us he's dead."
