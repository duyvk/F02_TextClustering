SUMMARY:
 These final regulations amend the existing 
regulations to reflect the provisions of section 10305 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 1989).
Section 10305 requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary), in making certain determinations
of good cause, without fault, and good faith under title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), take into account any
physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language)
the individual has. 
In addition, section 10305 amended title XVI of the Act to require that the Secretary take these limitations into account
in determining with respect to an individual's eligibility for title XVI benefits, whether the individual acted
in good faith or was without fault, and in determining fraud, deception, or intent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 On October 30, 1991, we published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 55848. We received comments from a
nonprofit public interest law center and a national nonprofit organization. Both organizations represent people
who are hearing impaired and both strongly supported the proposed rule and urged its adoption. The final rule, with
the exception of several technical changes we have made and which we discuss below, is the same as the NPRM. 
Sections 10305 (a), (b), (c), and (d) of OBRA 1989 amended sections 203(l), 204(b), 223(f), and 223(g)(2)(B) of title
II of the Act, respectively, to require that the Secretary, in making certain determinations and decisions of good
cause, fault, and good faith under the respective sections of the Act, take into account any physical, mental, educational,
or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has. In addition,
section 10305(e) of OBRA 1989 amended section 1631(c)(1) of title XVI of the Act to require that the Secretary take
these limitations into account in determining with respect to the eligibility of an individual for benefits under
title XVI, whether the individual acted in good faith or was without fault, and in determining fraud, deception, or
intent. The Conference Committee Report on OBRA 1989 indicates that the Congress intended that the amendment to section
1631(c)(1) of the Act would apply to provisions of title XVI that are similar to the title II provisions amended by sections
10305 (a) through (d). (H.R. Rep. No. 386, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 708 (1989).) The amendments made by section 10305
are effective for determinations or decisions made after June 30, 1990. 
Generally, it has been our policy to take into account the limitations described in section 10305 in making determinations
or decisions of good cause, without fault, or good faith (or determinations or decisions concerning fraudulent or
similar intent) with respect to the rights and duties of applicants and beneficiaries under the title II and title
XVI programs. However, our existing regulations were not explicit in this respect. Therefore, we are revising our
regulations under the title II and title XVI programs to reflect explicitly the amendments to the Act made by section
10305 of OBRA 1989. The changes to the regulations make it clear that we will take into account any physical, mental,
educational, or linguistic limitations of an individual (including any lack of facility with the English language)
in making a determination of good cause, without fault, or good faith, as appropriate, under section 203(l), 204(b),
223(f), or 223(g)(2)(B) of the Act (as required by the amendments made by sections 10305 (a) through (d)), and in determining
with respect to an individual's eligibility for benefits under title XVI of the Act, whether such individual acted
in good faith or was without fault, and in determining fraud, deception, or intent (as required under the amendment
made to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act by section 10305(e)). Also, in keeping with the intent of Congress and in the interest
of consistency, we are amending certain provisions of the title II regulations to provide expressly for the consideration
of the limitations described in section 10305 in making certain determinations and decisions under the title II program
which relate to good cause or fraudulent intent and which are not covered expressly by the amendments under sections
10305 (a) through (d) of OBRA 1989. The changes we are making are discussed below.
