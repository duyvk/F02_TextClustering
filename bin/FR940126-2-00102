Pertussis, also called whooping cough, is caused by a germ that 
easily passes from person to person. It can cause serious spells 
of coughing and choking for several weeks. For infants, having 
pertussis makes it hard to eat, drink, or breathe. It can lead 
to pneumonia, seizures, and sometimes even to lasting brain 
damage.
Should Everyone Get the DTP Vaccine?
Experts believe that almost all young children should get DTP or 
DTaP (a new form of the vaccine). To help your doctor/nurse know 
what is best for your child, please answer these questions.
Has the child getting the vaccine had DTP or DTaP in the 
past?
XXXX
Yes (please answer all the questions)
XXXX
No (you can skip these 6 questions)
<TABLE>
 
1 
1Yes
1No
1. Did the child have an allergic problem 
that required a medical visit right after 
DTP or DTaP in the past? 
} 
}
2. Did the child have an illness of the brain 
that led to a hospital stay 
within 7 days of DTP or DTaP? 
}

3. Did the child cry non-stop for more than 3 hours 
right after a DTP or DTaP? That is, did the 
crying go on even when the baby was 
cared for?

4. Did the child faint or collapse 
within 2 days (48 hours) of DTP or DTaP?

5. Did the child have a very high fever 
within 2 days (48 hours) of DTP or DTaP?

6. Did the child have a seizure within 3 days 
(72 hours) of DTP or DTaP?

</TABLE>
Please tell your doctor/nurse if the child getting the 
vaccine:
&bull;Has signs of illness today.
&bull;Has ever had a seizure.
&bull;Has a parent, brother, or sister who has had seizures.
If the answer is "yes" to any of these questions, your 
doctor/nurse might suggest getting DTP or DTaP, coming back for 
it later, not getting it at all, keeping the fever down after 
getting the shot, or using DT (a vaccine that protects from 
diphtheria and tetanus, but not from pertussis).
When Should Your Child Get the DTP Vaccine?
To be protected against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, most 
children need a total of 5 doses of vaccine. Children should get 
vaccine at:
2 months of age
4 months of age
6 months of age
15 to 18 months of age
4 to 6 years of age
A vaccine called DTaP vaccine is now available. DTaP or DTP may 
be used for the 4th and 5th shots.
These vaccines may be given at the same time as other childhood 
vaccines.
Every 10 years all through life, everyone needs a booster with 
tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td).
