LABOR: BY ORGANIZING, LIVING STANDARDS OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS COULD BE IMPROVED,

Income polarization is a legacy of the 1980s. From 1979 to 1987, the living 
standards of the richest fifth of American families rose by 19%. Those of the 
poorest fifth fell by 9%. 
</P>
<P>
During this business cycle, professional-technical occupations grew. But even 
more low-wage jobs in services and in labor-intensive manufacturing were 
created. By 1988, real wages, on average, were lower than at any time since 
1960. Poverty, once associated with unemployment, now comes with full-time 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Sacramento acknowledge crises of the working poor -- no health 
insurance, a shortage of low-income housing, child care's prohibitive cost. 
But, our leaders insist, tight budgets preclude new public programs. Instead, 
President Bush, using imagery of a "thousand points of light," pushes for 
private solutions. 
</P>
<P>
One private-sector solution, though shunned by conservatives, is unionization. 
It would improve living standards of low-wage workers, limiting pressure for 
new government programs. 
</P>
<P>
Today, barely 10% of private-sector workers are represented by unions. Labor's 
decline has aggravated urban poverty. Of the 37 million Americans without 
health insurance, two-thirds are employees or their dependents. Most work for 
non-union firms. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' work force now includes more than 300,000 in such low-wage 
industries as furniture, apparel, hotels and restaurants; 90% of them are 
non-union. Many earn minimum wage or less and receive no health benefits. A 
single apartment is frequently home for several of their families. 
</P>
<P>
What few union contracts there are in these industries usually specify an 
hourly rate of $6 to $7. Health insurance is almost always part of the 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The collective bargaining that produces these contracts preserves 
private-sector flexibility. The firms' ability to pay sets the upper limits on 
what unions can win. Sometimes, unions miscalculate, demanding contracts so 
rich that a firm can't survive. But recent history shows that when troubled 
companies have demanded wage and benefit reductions, unions often have gone 
along. Still, even the resulting lower wage scales remain higher than pay at 
comparable non-union firms. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, 200,000 workers a year, on average, were organized. In the 1980s, 
organizing rates were halved while low-wage employment grew. Possible reasons 
included labor's lack of resources devoted to recruiting, union corruption and 
publicity about "givebacks." But various legal obstacles to organizing and the 
impotence of labor law in the face of new employer tactics are the primary 
causes of the decline. Indeed, while Americans applaud Solidarity in Poland, 
U.S. labor law practically forecloses the right to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 3,000 Nissan workers in Tennessee voted against United Auto Workers 
representation. During the months leading up to the vote, Nissan broadcast 
anti-union messages on TV monitors located throughout its factory. To respond 
to this TV barrage, UAW organizers, barred from the plant, had to search out 
employee home addresses, visiting the workers in the evenings and on weekends. 
The law does not require that unions be given a voter list until several weeks 
before the vote, even though a campaign can run a year or longer. 
</P>
<P>
Americans would normally consider such election procedures -- one party having 
exclusive access to TV and to voter lists, requiring voters to listen to 
one-sided campaign rhetoric during paid working time -- unfair. Yet, this is 
how the National Labor Relations Board conducts representation elections to 
test if workers freely choose a union. 
</P>
<P>
The board and various court decisions have progressively diluted worker rights 
to free elections. For example, before 1980, if a company fired a union 
activist for tardiness, it had to produce records showing that late non-union 
workers had been similarly discharged. Under current rules, it is the union, 
though lacking access to personnel records, that must research and prove that a 
company discriminated against a union worker. Also, firings were previously 
unlawful if partly motivated by workers' union affiliation. Now, the labor 
relations board permits firms to cite union activism as a cause for dismissal, 
provided employers can demonstrate the legitimacy of other reasons. In short, 
the law protects only perfect employees. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the House of Representatives voted for labor law reform that would 
have eliminated the most egregious impediments to union organizing. But Senate 
supporters fell two votes short of the 60 needed to end an anti-union 
filibuster. The bill died. 
</P>
<P>
That legislation would have required union elections to be scheduled more 
promptly, increased the penalties for retaliating against union activists, 
provided unions with greater access to voters (including equal time when 
companies propagandize employees at the workplace) and allowed compensation to 
workers denied wage improvements because their companies unlawfully refused to 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Today, unionization of low-wage workers is not only a matter of their welfare. 
All taxpayers have an interest in encouraging collective bargaining to reduce 
the working poor's burden on public services. Toward that end, labor law reform 
should be made a priority by conservatives and liberals alike. The right of 
low-wage workers to improve their lot, without government subsidy, is surely 
one of those thousand points of light.
