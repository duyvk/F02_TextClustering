'Island Son' Reported Axed: Richard Chamberlain's latest show, "Island Son," is 
about to join "Dr. Kildare" in the television archives. Officials of Lorimar 
Productions, which produces the Hawaii-based show, told Teamsters who drive 
equipment trucks for the show that this week would be their final one, the 
Honolulu Advertiser reported. The newspaper also said that another union was 
advised that today would be the final day of filming and that Chamberlain, who 
plays Dr. Daniel Kulani on the show, was told of the decision by phone on 
Friday. Shauna Snow
