American and Soviet cancer specialists signed an agreement here Thursday for a 
10-year, $100-million study of 20,000 women in the two countries to determine 
whether a hormonal treatment can prevent breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Phillip D. Bretz, director of the Desert Breast Institute in Rancho Mirage, 
Calif., said that women thought to be most likely to develop breast cancer 
would be given tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug, and then be closely monitored 
by breast cancer specialists to see whether the drug could be used in 
preventive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Tamoxifen appears to be both the most promising and safest of all the drugs we 
know about for the prevention of breast cancer," Bretz said. "In the United 
States, the Soviet Union and in many industrialized countries, breast cancer is 
the most prevalent cancer among women." 
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen, which is manufactured by the British firm Imperial Chemical 
Industries and sold under the brand name Nolvadex, has been used with 
considerable success for 11 years in the post-surgical treatment of breast 
cancer patients to prevent a recurrence, Bretz said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed study is the first undertaken on such a scale jointly in the 
United States and the Soviet Union. The patients, about 10,000 each from the 
Soviet Union and the United States, will primarily be the daughters, sisters or 
mothers of women who have had breast cancer and thus are regarded as the most 
likely to develop cancer themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment involves taking two tablets a day. The researchers said that 
tamoxifen has minimal negative side effects and often reduces cholesterol and 
eases cardiovascular problems. 
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen works by blocking so-called estrogen receptors -- areas on the 
surface of cells to which the hormone binds to exert its effects. In that way, 
it blocks the effects of estrogen, which plays a role in the development and 
progression of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet women who were exposed to large amounts of radiation after the nuclear 
accident at Chernobyl in April, 1986, will also be included in the study, with 
the hope of preventing the development of breast cancer among them, according 
to Dr. David Zaridze, deputy director of the All-Union Cancer Research 
Institute in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
A new blood test, developed by Dr. Adeline Hackett of the Aeron Corp. of 
Oakland, Calif., and researchers at UC Berkeley is being used in the Ukrainian 
capital of Kiev, where many of the Chernobyl victims are treated, to measure 
the amount of radiation absorbed by each woman. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that radiation is carcinogenic for humans, but we do not know how 
carcinogenic -- that is, how much radiation is likely to increase the risk of 
various cancers and leukemias," Zaridze said. "In Hiroshima and Nagasaki (on 
which atomic bombs were dropped in World War II), there was an increase in all 
cancers and leukemias, but only about 300 cases of solid tumors and the same 
number of leukemias were directly attributed to radiation. We need to know more 
about how radiation causes tumors, and with this blood test we believe we can." 
</P>
<P>
Another blood test, also developed by Hackett, will be used to assess the level 
of tamoxifen in each woman's body and her response to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The tamoxifen study must still be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, which will hold an open hearing in Washington next month on the 
proposed scope and method of the research, but the U.S. researchers expressed 
confidence that the project would be approved and fully under way by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bretz said he expects the study's $100-million cost to be financed primarily 
with grants from the U.S. and Soviet governments and by pharmaceutical 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The project will be coordinated in the United States by Bretz and Dr. Philip B. 
Dreisbach of the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage and in the Soviet 
Union by Zaridze at the national Cancer Research Center and carried out in 
various cities in each country. 
</P>
<P>
"This drug has already proven to work in sustaining the post-operative 
remission in women who have had breast cancer and in preventing the spread of 
cancer to the other breast," Dreisbach said. "The time has come to determine 
whether it can prevent breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
In cases where breast cancer does develop among Soviet women, the project will 
also include the use of early laser surgery rather than radical surgery, 
radiation or chemotherapy, Bretz said.
