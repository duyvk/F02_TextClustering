Designation of critical habitat would not offer specific direction for managing marbled murrelet nesting habitat
nor provide a management or conservation plan for the species. Recovery plans typically provide guidance for conservation,
which may include population goals and the identification of areas that may need protection or special management.
Recovery plans usually include management recommendations for designated critical habitat. In February 1993,
the Service appointed a recovery team to develop a recovery plan for the marbled murrelet. The team plans to have a draft
recovery plan available in the spring of 1994. The Service will continue to work closely with the recovery team and
will reexamine proposed critical habitat in light of recovery team recommendations. 
Section 7_Consultation 
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out
are not likely to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies,
and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies ensure that their actions
are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. A Federal agency must consult with the
Service if its proposed action may affect a listed species or critical habitat. Regulations implementing this interagency
cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. 
Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as "* * * a direct
or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery
of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those
physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical." The jeopardy concept
is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be expected to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival
and recovery of a species. 
Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse modification and jeopardy, are directly related.
Survival may be viewed as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. The closer one is to recovery,
the greater the certainty in the species' continued survival. The terms survival and recovery are thus related by
the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a given period of time. Factors that influence a species'
persistence include population numbers, distribution throughout its range, stochasticity, expected duration,
and reproductive success. 
The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose of critical habitat is to contribute to a species'
conservation. Section 7 prohibitions against the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply
to actions that would impair survival and recovery of the listed species, thus providing a regulatory means of ensuring
that Federal actions within critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and recommendations of a recovery
plan. As a result of the link between critical habitat and recovery in the Act's definition of critical habitat, the
prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat should provide for the protection
of the critical habitat's ability to contribute to the recovery of the species. Thus, the adverse modification standard
may be reached closer to the recovery end of the survival continuum, whereas, the jeopardy standard has been applied
nearer to the extinction end of the continuum. 
After a proposal of critical habitat, section 7(a)(4) of the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR 402.10) require
Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification
of the proposed critical habitat. Conference reports provide advisory conservation recommendations to assist
a Federal agency in identifying and resolving conflicts that may be caused by the proposed action.
