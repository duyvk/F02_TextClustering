3. Fish Spawning Criteria 
a. Background 
In California, striped bass spawn primarily in the warmer freshwater segments of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.
Protection of spawning in both river systems is important to ensure the genetic diversity of the population as well
as to increase the size of the overall striped bass population. Adults spawn by migrating upstream from the San Francisco
Bay or from the Pacific Ocean (Stevens 1979; Wang 1986). The precise location and time of spawning appear to be controlled
by temperature and salinity (Turner 1972a; Turner and Chadwick 1972). According to the California DFG, striped bass
spawn successfully only in freshwater with electrical conductivities less than 0.44 millimhos
10
 per centimeter electroconductivity (mmhos/cm EC), and prefer to spawn in waters with conductivities below 0.33
mmhos/cm. Conductivities greater than 0.55 mmhos/cm appear to block the upstream migration of adult spawners (Radtke
and Turner 1967; SWRCB 1987; CDFG 1990b, WQCP-DFG-4).

The salinity problems addressed by the isohaline criteria outlined above are caused primarily by salt water intrusion
and are traditionally measured by "parts per thousand". In contrast, salinity conditions upstream in freshwater
are generally affected by dissolved salts from upstream water runoff. The salinity content of freshwater is traditionally
measured by its electroconductivity or "EC" standardized to 25 C (specific conductance), and is expressed in terms
of millimhos per centimeter electroconductivity or "mmhos/cm EC". 
</FOOTNOTE>
In the Sacramento River, adults migrate to spawning sites upstream of Sacramento until they encounter the appropriate
warmer temperatures for spawning. Because of the higher volume of water in the Sacramento River and the particular
constituents and volume of nonpoint source discharges into the river, salinity does not appear to be a serious limitation
on spawning at any location along the river. In years of higher spring river flows, with correspondingly lower water
temperatures, bass can spawn further upstream and later in the April-June period because the warmer temperatures
that induce spawning occur later (Chadwick 1958). Migration and spawning in the Sacramento River are therefore not
adversely affected by salinity. In the smaller and shallower San Joaquin River, however, the earlier occurrence
of warm temperatures causes the peak spawning period to occur earlier than in the Sacramento River; the San Joaquin
peak usually occurs in April or May rather than in May or June (Chadwick 1958). Migrating bass seeking the warmer waters
encounter excessive upstream salinity caused primarily by runoff. This salinity can block migration up the San Joaquin
River, thereby reducing spawning, and can also reduce survival of eggs (Farley 1966; Radtke 1966; Radtke and Turner
1967; Turner and Farley 1971; Turner 1972a, 1972b). 
The State Board's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan established objectives of 1.5 mmhos/cm EC at Antioch and 0.44 mmhos/cm EC at
Prisoners Point in April and May. EPA disapproved these objectives, in part, because they are not adequate to protect
spawning habitat in the reach farther upstream between Prisoners Point and Vernalis.
In the 1987 State Board hearings, California DFG testified that striped bass formerly spawned farther up the San Joaquin
River, but that this has occurred less frequently in recent years because of increased salinity levels (CDFG 1987).
Salinity in the San Joaquin River increases upstream of Prisoners Point due to reduced freshwater inflow and agricultural
return flows. Thus the absence of salinity criteria above Prisoners Point effectively establishes a barrier to adult
migration and spawning farther upstream on the San Joaquin River (Turner 1972a,b). California DFG also suggested
that there was a danger of losing the part of the population that spawned in this area if high salinities prevent spawning
or decrease survival of newly spawned eggs (CDFG 1987; SWRCB. Phase I Hearing Transcript, LXXV, VII 111:3-14).
In the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan, the State Board described several alternative water quality standards that would have
extended the protection of spawning conditions upstream of Prisoners Point, including one alternative very similar
to the one EPA is proposing today. However, the State Board deferred adoption of revised standards, apparently because
of concern that improved spawning conditions would lead to greater losses of young to entrainment at the State and
Federal pumping plants. As indicated in its September 3, 1991 letter disapproving certain State criteria, EPA believes
that the State Board can, in developing its implementation measures, address the impact of the pumps on this spawning
habitat. 
EPA also disapproved the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan spawning criteria because they were not based on sound science. The State
Board explained that the 1.5 mmhos/cm EC criteria at Antioch was intended to protect spawning habitat upstream of
Antioch (near Jersey Point), not at the Antioch location itself. The State Board acknowledged that "the use of 1.5
[mmhos/cm] EC at Antioch appears not to be generally appropriate, and proposed that a thorough review of this [criteria]
be undertaken at the next triennial review" (1991 Bay/Delta Plan, p. 5-32). EPA found this indirect and unproven
approach of setting criteria downstream in hopes of attaining different criteria upstream deficient, and disapproved
it. EPA's proposed criteria would correct this deficiency by establishing the scientifically-defensible criteria
at Jersey Point, the actual point of concern. 
The State Board also acknowledged that the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan spawning criteria did not protect the spawning reach
in the lower San Joaquin River, but instead only at two locations: Jersey Point and Prisoners Point (1991 Bay/Delta
Plan, p. 5-30). As a result, the State Board directed California DFG to study how a specific habitat zone of 0.44
mmhos/cm EC could be established in the entire reach between Jersey Point and Prisoners Point "to make certain that
the State Board develops water quality objectives that are based on sound scientific data" (1991 Bay/Delta Plan,
p. 5-33). EPA agrees, and is proposing criteria to assure that the entire reach between Jersey Point and Prisoners
Point should be protected.
