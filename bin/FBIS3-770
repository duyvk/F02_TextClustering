  [Text] Fifty-two magisterial districts have been declared 
unrest areas as a result of the events in Bophuthatswana. The 
minister of law and order, Mr. Hernus Kriel, said this step had 
been taken to prevent the possible spread of violence from 
Bophuthatswana to South Africa. The areas include virtually all 
towns and cities in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] area, as well as large parts of the western 
Transvaal, the northern Transvaal the [Orange] Free State, and 
northern Cape.
