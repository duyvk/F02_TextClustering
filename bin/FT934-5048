Red Book details
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section summarises the tax and national insurance proposals in the
Budget. The measures will raise extra revenue building up over the next
three years to around  3/4 per cent of GDP, while minimising any damage to
incentives and to the long term performance of the economy. They include a
number of proposals to help business and in particular to encourage
investment in small and growing businesses.
The effect of the measures on government revenues is set out in the
accompanying table.
Inland Revenue
Income tax: There will be no change to the main income tax allowances or the
income limit for age-related allowances for 1994-95. The blind person's
allowance will be increased to Pounds 1,200.
The basic rate is unchanged at Pounds 23,700.
From 6 April 1995 tax relief for the married couple's allowance, and
allowances linked to it, will be restricted to 15 per cent. There will be no
change to the amount of the married couple's allowance for those aged under
65, and the allowances linked to it. The married couple's allowance for
those aged 65 and over will be increased by Pounds 330. Tax relief for the
first Pounds 1,720 of maintenance payments will also be restricted to 15 per
cent from 1995-96.
Tax relief for mortgage interest payments will be restricted to 15 per cent
with effect from 6 April 1995. Relief will remain at 25 per cent for those
aged 65 and over who take out a loan to buy a life annuity.
Sickness benefit and invalidity benefit will be replaced by a new benefit,
to be known as incapacity benefit, from 6 April 1995. The new benefit will
be liable to tax for new recipients from that date. The element which
replaces sickness benefit will not be taxed.
Tax relief for private medical insurance for those aged 60 and over will be
restricted to the basic rate with effect from 6 April 1994.
Tax relief for vocational training will be extended to National Vocational
Qualifications and Scottish Vocational Qualifications at level 5 from 1
January 1994. From the same date, tax relief will no longer be available to
children under 16; to 16 to 18 year olds at school full time; or for
training which is mainly for recreation or leisure.
Benefits in kind: The scales for assessing the benefit of fuel provided by
employers for private use in company cars will be increased by 6 per cent
from 6 April 1994. The scales are also used for employers' national
insurance contributions. The fuel scales for VAT will be similarly amended.
The tax treatment of cheap loans provided by employers will be revised from
6 April 1994. Employees will be taxed as if they had received cash instead
of a cheap or interest free loan, and will receive tax relief for the
interest they would have paid. Loans of up to Pounds 5,000 will be exempt.
There will be a new exemption for certain commercial loans and provision to
set an official rate of interest to measure the benefit of some loans in
currencies other than sterling.
Simplification and reform of tax: As announced in the March Budget, the
assessment and collection of personal tax will be simplified from 1996-97.
The main measures will abolish the preceding year basis of assessment for
income tax, and tax income as it arises from 1997-98, with a transitional
year in 1996-97; offer the option of self-assessment to all who complete tax
returns; align payment dates for assessed income tax from all sources and
for capital gains tax; introduce separate assessment for partners; and
introduce clear rules for filing tax returns and paying tax, and penalties
for failing to comply with them.
Other measures are:
the existing requirements to provide information about offshore trusts will
be clarified;
the procedure by which lenders are admitted to the MIRAS scheme will be
simplified, with effect from Royal Assent;
the capital gains tax rules for payments under certain financial and
commodity options and futures contracts will be amended for contracts
entered into from 30 November 1993 ;
improvements will be made to the operation of the tax regime for approved
pension schemes;
amendments will be made to the rules for approved profit sharing schemes to
equalise the tax treatment of men and women in schemes approved before 25
July 1991 and to improve the treatment of qualifying corporate bonds;
stamp duty legislation will be amended to clarify the meaning of execution
(with effect from 8 December 1993); and to relax the penalties on the late
stamping of agreements for lease (with effect from 6 May 1994).
Limits and exempt amounts: The capital gains tax annual exempt amount will
remain at Pounds 5,800 for individuals and Pounds 2,900 for most trusts.
The threshold for inheritance tax will remain at Pounds 150,000.
The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made with
tax relief (the earnings cap) will be increased in line with inflation to
Pounds 76,800.
Investment in small businesses: A new Enterprise Investment Scheme will be
introduced from 1 January 1994 to encourage equity investment by individuals
in unquoted trading companies. The scheme will provide relief on investments
at a rate of 20 per cent, and income or capital gains tax relief on losses.
Capital gains will be tax free. It will not be available for investments in
private rented housing. Investors previously unconnected with the company
will be able to become paid directors. The maximum amount that can be
invested in any one tax year will be Pounds 100,000. (For 1993-94 the limit
will be Pounds 40,000 for total investments in the Business Expansion Scheme
and in the new scheme). The maximum amount a company can raise under the
scheme in any 12 month period will be Pounds 1m.
A consultative document will be issued on a scheme for Venture Capital
Trusts to encourage investment in unquoted trading companies.
Liability to capital gains tax arising on the disposal of assets on or after
30 November 1993 by individuals and most trustees will be deferred when the
gains are reinvested in unquoted shares of qualifying trading companies.
The limits for capital gains tax retirement relief are to be increased. For
qualifying disposals made on or after 30 November 1993 full relief will be
available on the first Pounds 250,000 of gains, and 50 per cent relief on
the next Pounds 750,000.
Lifetime gifts of business and agricultural property sold by a donee qualify
for relief under inheritance tax where they are replaced by similar assets
within one year.
This period will be extended to three years, for deaths on or after 30
November 1993.
Business taxation: Following consultation announced in the March Budget, a
foreign income dividend (FID) scheme will be introduced to help companies
with surplus advance corporation tax (ACT) arising from dividends paid out
of foreign profits.
From 1 July 1994 a company may opt to classify a dividend as a FID. ACT will
be payable in the usual way, but where the dividend is paid out of foreign
profits, surplus ACT may be reclaimed. Unlike an ordinary dividend, a FID
will not carry a tax credit, but will be treated as having borne tax at the
lower rate. There will be special rules for international headquarters
companies.
The profits limits for the small companies' rate of corporation tax will be
increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 1.5m from 1 April
1994.
Two changes are proposed to help businesses faced with insolvency.
From 30 November 1993 a creditor will not be denied tax relief for trade
debts given up as part of a voluntary arrangement under the 1986 Insolvency
Act, solely because the creditor could have recovered more of the debt by
putting the debtor into liquidation or bankruptcy. For the debtor, the
amount given up will no longer be liable to tax. The rules for reducing VAT
repayments from Customs to take account of tax due to them will be relaxed,
from shortly after Royal Assent. This will have the effect of putting VAT
debts on a similar footing to debts owed to other creditors.
Tax relief for business donations to Training and Enterprise Councils and
similar bodies, which was due to expire on 1 April 1995, will be extended to
1 April 2000. In addition, tax relief will be available for business
donations to Business Links made from 30 November 1993 to 1 April 2000.
All payments made on or after 30 November 1993 as a result of extortion by
terrorist groups or other criminals will be disallowed for tax purposes.
Improvements will be made to the new rules for foreign exchange gains and
losses announced in the March Budget. The new rules will come into force on
a date to be announced.
The tax treatment of financial instruments used by companies for managing
interest rate and currency risk will be reformed so that all the profits and
losses on these instruments will be taxed or relieved as income as they
accrue. The reforms will be implemented from the same date as the new rules
on foreign exchange gains and losses.
The Inland Revenue will review the rules for the taxation of interest paid
and received by companies. The review will also consider taxation of the
return to investors in securities.
Other minor changes are:
tax provisions will be made for British Rail and Northern Ireland Airports,
in line with earlier privatisations;
the capital allowances provisions for connected persons will be amended to
include transfers of enterprise zone commercial buildings and qualifying
hotels prior to 16 March 1993. The March Budget made similar provisions for
such transfers on or after that date.
Oil taxation: The technical rules governing the price of oil or gas charged
to petroleum revenue tax (PRT) and, where appropriate, corporation tax and
royalty, will be modified with effect from 1 January 1994 to take account of
changes in the markets.
In certain circumstances companies will be able to elect that a proportion
of expenditure on assets, such as pipelines, providing services to other
fields will be ineligible for PRT relief, and that tariffs received from new
fields exempt from PRT will be outside the PRT charge (*).
Anti-avoidance and revenue protection measures: Employers who pay their
employees in marketable assets such as gold bars will be obliged to account
for income tax under PAYE when the payment is made. Such payments are
currently treated as benefits in kind on which employees pay income tax
after the end of the tax year. Parallel measures will be applied to national
insurance contributions.
Changes will be made to the rules for profit related pay schemes. These will
affect the upper limit on the profits which an employer may disregard in
calculating profit related pay, and the requirements which have to be met if
a special scheme (a scheme for a particular unit within a business) is to
qualify for tax relief.
For disposals of assets on or after 30 November 1993, capital gains
indexation allowance will only be able to extinguish a gain, and will not be
able to create or augment a loss.
Where a company fails to meet corporation tax liabilities which arise prior
to its sale to another company, the Inland Revenue will be able to collect
the unpaid tax from the previous owners of the company or from other
companies in the same group. This will apply to contracts entered into on or
after 30 November 1993.
In order to pursue an acceptable distribution policy non-trading foreign
companies controlled by UK companies will have to distribute at least 90 per
cent of their taxable profits less capital gains and foreign taxes, for
accounting periods ending on or after 30 November 1993.
Changes will be made, with effect from 8 December 1993, to counter avoidance
of stamp duty on exchanges of interests in land; on property transferred for
a price which is not ascertainable at the time the document is executed; and
on agreements to surrender a lease (other than by a deed).
Provisions will be introduced, with retrospective effect, to ensure that tax
continues to be collected under PAYE from certain groups of foreign
employees coming to work in the UK.
New capital allowance rules will be introduced to limit the extent to which
taxpayers can backdate claims for assets reclassified as plant; and to
prevent buildings and structures being reclassified as plant in future.
The rules for taxing payments made in lieu of dividends or interest will be
clarified with effect from 30 November 1993. The scope of the rules will
also be extended, with effect from a date to be announced, to cover
compensation for dividends or interest which takes the form of a price
adjustment rather than a payment.
Measures will be taken to deter avoidance of petroleum revenue tax through
transfers of pipelines or other tariff-earning assets between fields.
Companies which are resident in the UK, but which would be regarded as
resident in another country for the purposes of a double taxation agreement,
will be treated as not resident in the UK for all tax purposes from 30
November 1993.
Non-residents carrying on business in the UK will not be able to claim
relief for losses incurred as a result of the exemption of royalty income
under a double taxation convention. The restriction will apply to accounting
periods beginning on or after 30 November 1993.
A benefit received from a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme will
be taxed if the scheme itself has not been subject to UK tax.
Customs and Excise
Value added tax: The turnover threshold above which traders are required to
register for VAT will rise from Pounds 37,600 to Pounds 45,000, and the
deregistration threshold will rise from Pounds 36,000 to Pounds 43,000, from
1 December 1993.
The minimum supplement paid to traders when VAT refunds are unduly delayed
by Customs will rise from Pounds 30 to Pounds 50, from one month after Royal
Assent. Customs will be allowed less time to investigate repayment claims
before becoming liable to pay the supplement.
Businesses leasing cars to private taxi and self-drive hire firms and to
driving schools will be able to recover the VAT they pay on cars bought for
this purpose from 1 January 1994.
Excise duties: The duties on tobacco and fuel will be increased from 6pm on
30 November 1993. Duty on wines and cider will rise and duty on fortified
wines will be reduced on 1 January 1994. Duty on beer and spirits will
remain unchanged. The change in duty and its effect on the price of each
product is set out below:
The duty on road fuels will be raised on average by at least 5 per cent in
real terms in future Budgets, an increase from the 3 per cent commitment
given in the March Budget. Developments in charging for road use will be
taken into account in determining the appropriate level of duty.
Duty on tobacco will be increased on average by at least 3 per cent in real
terms in future Budgets, as a contribution towards meeting the targets for
reductions in smoking in the Health of the Nation White Paper.
There are a number of measures to modernise tax law and reduce burdens on
business:
the administration of gaming machine licence duty will be restructured. This
will apply from 1 March 1994 for traders operating only over the summer
season, and from 1 May 1994 for others;
powers relating to customs offences will be modernised and brought into line
with those for VAT and excise. This will allow an audit based system of
control;
criminal penalties for many of the less serious excise offences are to be
replaced by a system of fixed penalties;
the jurisdiction of VAT tribunals will be extended to cover traders' appeals
against decisions on excise and customs matters, by 1 January 1995.
Insurance premium tax: A new tax will be introduced at a rate of 3 per cent
on insurance premiums for most general risks in the UK, from 1 October 1994.
It will not apply to life insurance, pensions and other defined classes of
long term insurance; insurance of certain ships and aircraft, international
railway rolling stock, and goods in international transit; export credit
insurance, or reinsurance.
Air passenger duty: A new duty will be payable by passengers travelling by
air from UK airports from 1 October 1994. It will be charged at Pounds 5 per
passenger for destinations in the UK or the EC, and Pounds 10 for
destinations elsewhere. There will be exemptions for the return leg of
journeys within the UK on a return ticket, children under two who travel
free, transit and transfer passengers, and passengers in small aircraft.
Vehicle excise duty: Duty on cars, light goods vehicles, vans and taxis will
rise from Pounds 125 to Pounds 130 from 1 December 1993. New rates will be
set for combined transport lorries, to come into force in 1994. Rates of
duty for other lorries are unchanged.
Business rates
England and Wales: Poundages will be increased in line with the increase in
the RPI in the year to September 1993.
The maximum real increase in bills faced by properties in England and Wales
which are in transition to higher bills as a result of the 1990 reforms will
be reduced by half. This means that real increases will be limited to 10 per
cent for large properties and 7 1/2 per cent for small properties. Rates
bills for small properties in transition which are used for both business
and domestic purposes will be frozen in real terms. This change will reduce
the total rates bill in England and Wales by 0.8 per cent.
Scotland and Northern Ireland: Scotland and Northern Ireland have different
arrangements for business rates but their total rates bill for 1994-95 will
also be reduced by 0.8 per cent.
National insurance
The main rate of employers' national insurance contributions will be reduced
by 0.2 per cent, and the lower rates by 1 per cent, from April 1994.
From April 1994 the lower earnings limit will be increased from Pounds 56 to
Pounds 57 a week, in line with the single person's rate of retirement
pension; the earnings thresholds for the employers' lower rate bands will
each be increased by Pounds 5 to Pounds 100, Pounds 145 and Pounds 200; and
the upper earnings limit will be increased from Pounds 420 to Pounds 430 a
week.
Treasury grant not exceeding 16 per cent of contributory benefit expenditure
will be made available to the National Insurance Fund in 1994-95.
The Government Actuary will report on the likely effect of these changes on
the National Insurance Fund.
