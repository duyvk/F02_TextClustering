FT  27 OCT 93 / Management: The unions step on board - The US steel industry
is taking part in an experiment in employee involvement

After 10 years of losses, lay-offs and falling market share, the US's
biggest steel companies have come up with a new way to improve their
competitiveness: allow union representatives on to their boards.
Five of the six big integrated steel companies have already concluded
agreements with the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) in a move which
amounts to one of the most far-reaching experiments in employee involvement
undertaken in any US industry. US Steel, the country's biggest producer,
could follow suit later this week, if company and union negotiators meet
their deadline of reaching a new labour agreement by Friday.
No other US industry has ever experimented with union involvement on this
scale. Individual companies, most notably Chrysler, have conceded board
seats to their unions in the past, but the practice has never taken root
across an entire industry before.
The agreements also provide for union involvement in committees at all
levels of management.
Yet the benefits of worker participation on this scale remain unproven. Will
it make any difference to the flagging fortunes of the big steel companies,
which are struggling to catch up with newer, un-unionised competitors?
And will the changes turn out to be anything more than temporary, just
another phase in 'Big Steel's' long decline?
The US's six big integrated steel companies (those involved in every step of
steel production, from making the coke for use in their furnaces, to rolling
out and coating finished steel sheets) have already cut their combined
workforce from 270,000 at the start of the 1980s to fewer than 100,000 now.
They have invested more than Dollars 13bn (Pounds 9.2bn) between them in the
past decade to become more efficient.
However, with overcapacity in the worldwide steel industry and the inroads
made by the small 'mini-mills' and reconstituted mills at home, a return to
sustained profitability remains elusive.
In new six-year accords struck with the USWA this summer, four companies -
Inland, followed by Bethlehem, National and Armco - agreed to appoint union
representatives to their boards and to adopt extensive co-management
arrangements. A fifth, LTV, has activated a similar plan since coming out of
bankruptcy protection at the end of June.
There are two ways to explain the development. One - espoused publicly by
the companies and the union - is that giving workers more of a say will lead
to more efficient production methods and make the companies more
competitive. 'It's kind of an unorthodox way of dealing with the problem,'
says John Jacobson of Wefa Group, an economic research company. 'But they
haven't been very successful with anything else they've tried.'
The other, more cynical, view is that companies find it easier to lay off
workers or overhaul their working practices if they adopt a less
confrontational approach to labour relations: it is difficult for union
leaders to oppose big changes if they have been closely involved in their
origin.
According to some labour relations experts, this motivation may lie behind
many of the attempts in the US at employee participation since the
mid-1980s.
'When companies have excess capacity, this could be a way of making the
cutbacks more palatable,' says John Dunlop, a former US labour secretary and
chairman of a commission set up by the Clinton administration in March to
look at the legal framework for labour relations in the US.
Either way, the agreements should have an indirect benefit for the steel
companies in the short term. In return for the promises of greater
participation in management and a guarantee that there will be no compulsory
redundancies, steelworkers have agreed to a freeze in basic pay for the next
two years and to greater job flexibility.
But it is less clear whether the participation agreements will yield the
sort of sustained productivity improvements their supporters claim. There
are at least two reasons why some of the hoped-for productivity gains could
prove elusive.
First, and perhaps most important, old attitudes on both sides of the
union/management divide die hard. Labour relations in the industry have
traditionally been adversarial, says John Goodwin, manager of US Steel's
Gary, Indiana, plant, the biggest in the US. 'We've got a long way to go -
we've got 80 years of history to overcome.'
Second, there are very different perceptions of what closer union
involvement in management actually means. Will the union's representatives
have an influence over strategic and other decisions taken by the big steel
companies, or are they simply being invited into the executive suite to
observe?
Both sides talk glibly of a new-style 'partnering' approach to management,
preferring to hide behind this piece of management-school jargon rather than
face up to the real question: does the new approach amount to a form of
co-management, or simply as an extended exercise in worker communication?
'What they (the union) want is to see what's happening and why decisions are
made, rather than trying to take decisions themselves,' says Joseph Emig,
manager of Bethlehem Steel's plant at Burns Harbour in northern Indiana,
which is now the home of the US steel industry.
Some union officials appear to agree. Jack Parton, director of the USWA's
East Chicago district, says: 'I can't run a steel mill. I didn't go to
business school, and I don't intend to go to business school now.'
He and other officials have recently been invited to attend the regular
fortnightly meeting of senior Inland Steel executives, called to review
progress against the company's plans. They are not there to second-guess the
line managers whose responsibility it is to meet certain targets, he says.
But other union representatives talk of more positive involvement and it
seems unlikely that they would sit passively as decisions were taken that
would harm their members' interests.
The difference of perception is most acute when it comes to the question of
board-level representation. The steel companies point to the legal
responsibilities the union's directors will face.
'The first, foremost and only obligation of every director is to represent
the interests of shareholders,' says an official at Inland Steel.
Union members, though, cling to the idea that the directors they nominate
will represent their interests, not those of the shareholders. To some, it
seems like an opportunity to fight the old union/management battle from the
inside. 'Boards give their management people golden handcuffs - we hope we
will now be able to put a stop to things like that,' says Andy Hopkins, a
tractor driver at Bethlehem's Burns Harbour plant and a part-time union
official.
Doug Frazer, a former head of the United Auto Workers, agrees. In the 1970s,
he became the first union leader to sit on the board of a leading US company
when he was appointed a director of Chrysler. Union-appointed directors are
there to fight for the interests of workers, he says. They also have a right
to tell their members everything their boards do.
'I said that as far as I was concerned, nothing was confidential. There's
not enough openness in these large organisations.'
Such comments send shudders through secrecy minded executives. But, in
practice, the union-nominated directors are likely to be able to exert
little direct influence, even if they wanted to.
'It will not make a difference to the way the company operates. But if it
makes all our employees understand better why decisions are taken, it will
help,' says Curtis Barnette, chairman of Bethlehem.
It is also questionable whether the new arrangements will stand the test of
time. The history of US labour relations is littered with similar examples
of experiments at employee involvement that did not last.
It takes a crisis to encourage companies to let workers on to their boards,
says Frazer. When Chrysler had returned from the brink, the union seat was
quietly dropped. 'I think they stole that seat from us,' says Frazer.
If all the big steel companies agree to let union representatives on to
their boards, the experiment this time could at least prove longer lasting.
