sentences immediately before the second sentence of the 
introductory text of paragraph (e) to read as follows: 
Sect.404.422 
Deductions because of refusal to accept rehabilitation 
services. 
* * * * * 
(e) * * * In determining whether an individual has good cause 
for refusing rehabilitation services, we will take into account 
any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) the 
individual may have which may have caused the individual to 
refuse such services. We also consider other factors that may 
have caused an individual to refuse such services. * * * 
* * * * * 
3. Section 404.454 is amended by revising the third and 
fourth sentences of the introductory text of paragraph (a), by 
removing the word "or" that follows the semicolon at the end of 
paragraph (a)(7), by removing the period at the end of paragraph

paragraph (a)(9) to read as follows: 
Sect.404.454 
Good cause for failure to make required reports. 
(a) 
General
. * * * The failure of the individual to submit 
evidence to establish good cause within a specified time may be 
considered a sufficient basis for a finding that good cause does 
not exist (see Sect.404.705). In determining whether good cause for 
failure to report timely has been established by the individual, 
consideration is given to whether the failure to report within 
the proper time limit was the result of untoward circumstances, 
misleading action of the Social Security Administration, 
confusion as to the requirements of the Act resulting from 
amendments to the Act or other legislation, or any physical, 
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any 
lack of facility with the English language) the individual may 
have. * * *

(9) Failure of the individual to understand reporting 
responsibilities due to his or her physical, mental, educational, 
or linguistic limitation(s).

and any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations

6. Section 404.510 is amended by revising the section 
heading, by removing the last sentence of paragraph (n) and by 
revising the introductory text of Sect.404.510 to read as follows: 
Sect.404.510 
When an individual is "without fault" in a deduction 
overpayment. 
In determining whether an individual is "without fault" with 
respect to a deduction overpayment, the Social Security 
Administration will consider all pertinent circumstances, 
including the individual's age and intelligence, and any 
physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) the 
individual has. Except as provided in Sect.404.511 or elsewhere in 
this subpart F, situations in which an individual will be 
considered to be "without fault" with respect to a deduction 
overpayment include, but are not limited to, those that are 
described in this section. An individual will be considered 
"without fault" in accepting a payment which is incorrect because 
he/she failed to report an event specified in sections 203 (b) and 
(c) of the Act, or an event specified in section 203(d) of the 
Act as in effect for monthly benefits for months after December 
1960, or because a deduction is required under section 203 (b), 
(c), (d), or section 222(b) of the Act, or payments were not 
withheld as required by section 202(t) or section 228 of the Act, 
if it is shown that such failure to report or acceptance of the 
overpayment was due to one of the following circumstances:
