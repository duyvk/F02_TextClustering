In the most comprehensive scientific report on diet and health to date, the 
National Research Council on Wednesday called for broad changes in American 
eating habits and gave specific recommendations to eat much less fat, eat more 
fruits, vegetables and starches and avoid high-dose vitamin and mineral 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
The council recommended that people daily eat five or more half-cup portions of 
fruits and vegetables and a minimum of six portions of starches such as breads, 
cereals and beans. The recommendations would roughly double the average amounts 
of these items eaten by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The council also said it found no proof that calcium and fiber supplements 
confer any health benefit. While the panel did not conclude that daily 
vitamin-mineral supplements are harmful, it found no evidence that they are 
beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were prepared by a committee of 19 diet and health experts 
created to resolve conflicting dietary advice that in recent years has come 
from various private and governmental bodies. The panel took three years to 
examine nearly 6,000 studies and compile a 1,400-page report that distills the 
various findings into one set of dietary guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Among other conclusions of the report were these: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Evidence linking coffee to heart disease and cancer is inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urges Sugar Limits 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sugar has not been established as a risk factor for any chronic disease 
other than cavities. Refined sugar, like that used in cakes and cookies, should 
be limited, however, since it contributes calories with no essential nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Food additives do not appear to have contributed to the overall risk of 
cancer in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is no evidence that pesticides or natural toxins in food contribute 
significantly to cancer risk in the United States. But the risks for 
simultaneous exposure to these compounds has not been adequately tested. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a committee of the National Research Council, the 
working arm of the National Academy of Sciences, has made such definitive 
dietary recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Confusion 
</P>
<P>
"Many people may be confused by the vast amount of advice given in many forms 
about what to eat," said Dr. Arno G. Motulsky, chairman of the Committee on 
Diet and Health. "Some may have delayed making changes in their diets until 
they are more convinced that scientists have reached consensus. We hope our 
report will help these individuals move from inaction and complacency to 
action." 
</P>
<P>
The committee said the risk of heart disease could be reduced by at least 20% 
if the public followed the fat and cholesterol guidelines. Americans currently 
consume 37% of their calories as fat. The committee endorsed a reduction to 30% 
-- as many other health groups have recommended -- but it acknowledged that 
level is only "moderately" low in fat and said further reductions would provide 
additional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also said the risk of cancer of the colon, lung and stomach could 
be reduced by sharply increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, 
particularly citrus fruits and green and yellow vegetables.
