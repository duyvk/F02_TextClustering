  [Text] The Honorable chairman, members of the Executive 
Committee, members of the National Representative Council, 
members of the council, representatives of member organizations 
of the Volksfront National Front, and honorable fellow citizens. 
This massive demonstration this morning is proof that a turning 
point has been reached in the history of South Africa. 
[applause] Ladies and gentlemen, this massive demonstration this 
morning has shown clearly and fearlessly that we are united in 
our attempt to preserve our freedom. Ladies and gentlemen -- 
that we are united in saying that we will not give up our right 
to self-determination, that we are united in our will to 
establish our own state and to govern that state. Friends, I 
think what has happened here this morning demonstrates to the 
world, which thinks that the Afrikaner nation has been 
flattened, but it is heartening to see the Afrikaner nation 
demonstrating here this morning. The people are standing up in 
its quest for freedom and in its quest for self-determination in 
its own state. 
  Sir, this is the uniting factor, which binds this nation 
together today, but there is more than this. There is another 
factor uniting us and this is the factor, and this is the most 
important, and this is the overwhelming one, that we are not 
only united in our quest for freedom, but we are united in our 
courage before the king of all kings, and this brings our nation 
together. 
  Sir, the freedom -- we have not stolen this from anyone. We 
did not get this at anyone's expense. This freedom is granted 
to every other nation in the world and now it is expected of the 
Afrikaner nation to voluntarily give up its freedom. The answer 
we give today is: It will never happen that we will give up our 
freedom. [applause] 
  Sir, even the United Nations, the whole world recognizes the 
right to self- determination of nations. In South Africa we 
have nations who have self-determination -- the Swazis, the 
Sothos -- in Africa we have nations with the right to 
self-determination, but the Afrikaner nation, the Zulu nation, 
the Tswana nation, and other nations have to be subjected 
because it does not fit in with communists' plans for these 
people to be free. 
  For this reason, Mr. Chairman, what we want to legally 
protect today is something we have. We are not on a campaign to 
conquer anything. We have our freedom and we are not a 
conquered nation, we have self-determination. We have a 
country. We are not conquering anything. We are here together 
to tell the world: Here stands the Afrikaner nation, and we are 
not an aggressive nation committing aggressive deeds. We are 
not a nation trying to establish anarchy. We are not a nation 
that has left a trail of blood behind us in this country, like 
the Americans and the Australians. We built up this land with 
patriotism, with love, with dedication, and sacrifice and sweat 
and blood, and we are here to protect that to which we are 
rightfully entitled, and not to give it up, and this we will not 
allow them to take away. [applause] 
  Mr. Chairman, we are gathered here today to tell each other: 
We are here to publicly show our united national will and to 
undertake to each other that we will protect this freedom and 
these rights with everything at our disposal until we die or 
triumph. This we undertake to each other. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the big question is -- one of the big 
questions: What is the threat to this nation. What is the 
threat to our nation, //and ladies and gentlemen, I would like 
to deal with this threat in English, because I've got in my 
possession a document of the South African Communist Party 
[SACP], and it deals with Operation Sunrise, which is an 
extension of Operation Vula. And in this document they say the 
dangers for them, one of the dangers, which will ensure that 
they do not achieve their goals -- if the agenda of the South 
African Communist Party is exposed to the international 
community, and therefore I challenge the press today. If you 
want a communist government in South Africa, then you must 
remain silent, but if you ... if you object, and if you want to 
resist to a communist takeover in South Africa then you must 
expose the plan of the South African Communist Party, not only 
to the inhabitants of South Africa, but to the whole 
international community [applause], because sir, this ... this 
plan is taking place and is developing in South Africa, and in 
this document it is stated. It deals with Operation Sunrise, 
under the heading, yes, danger for us and that you must expose 
to the world. 
  //Their aims: Our main objective which was and still is to 
seize power. Our underground structures -- their underground 
structures -- will have to deliver during this period. We must 
secure a two- thirds majority. A big event just before the 
elections will help greatly, perhaps similar to the death of 
Hani, will do it for us. The anger that such an event will 
precipitate amongst the people will serve as a powerful 
stimulus, say for instance the death of Mandela. If there is 
anything sinister about his death it would suit us at that stage. 
  //They say the South African Communist Party is firmly in 
control of the ANC [African National Congress]. We secure a 
leadership position in the ANC, COSATU [Congress of South 
African Trade Unions], SANCO [South African National Civic 
Organization], and in the Women's League and other 
organizations. The ANC will in actual fact be our shadow 
parliament. The ANC will be there. Their strategies: We at 
the same time launch Operation Sunrise, this strategy is based 
more or less on the Vula formula. Ciskei was to be a test 
ground for the insurrectionists within our party. The aim was 
to develop a domino effect, of partial interaction in Ciskei, 
Bophuthatswana, and kwaZulu. Venda and Transkei were ours 
already, and if we could manipulate events so that the other 
three collapsed, it would be possible to instigate a national 
insurrection.// 
  //It has happened. We have witnessed it. It has happened. 
They said: Destroy the security force, then we embark on a 
full program to weaken their security powers. Operation Hunter, 
inter alia, with Operation Hunter we hope to get rid of the bad 
elements in the police. That is happening in front of your eyes 
-- to establish a communist state in three phases. Phase one 
until after the elections, second phase will start right after 
the elections. Transformation from capitalism to socialism will 
take place during the second phase. Want to restruct in order 
to ... [pauses] The capitalists want to reconstruct in order to 
make profit. That is, of course, not our aim. We want to use 
reconstruction to transform South Africa into a worker state. 
Phase three, once the socialist struggle has been completed the 
third and final phase will start, in order to transform our 
socialist South Africa into a classless, communist state. We 
cannot allow farmers to own land that belongs to the people. 
The Afrikaner homeland will never be allowed.// 
  Sir, this is the strategy and this is the plan of the South 
African Communist Party, and it is being realized in front of 
your eyes, step for step, without any exception. What can we 
deduce from this? This revolutionary, communist takeover is 
unfolding according to plan, and now we ask the question: Why is 
the government allowing this? Because, Sir, if we have this 
information at our disposal then the government also has this 
information at its disposal. The reason it is allowing this is 
because it is a willing partner to the execution of this plan. 
Sir, and I challenge the government and the state president, if 
you want to be a willing partner why did you not at least inform 
the people of South Africa about this plan unfolding now, one 
which you must be aware of. Why did you not at least inform the 
people. Sir, we see in advertisements the electorate is 
supporting the ANC and the SACP, but the government has put them 
in this position, enabling them to make South Africa a communist 
state. 
  Mr. Chairman, with this plan they say a two-thirds majority 
with or without violence. If they can get it without violence 
then good, but Sir, to encourage protests and violence in order 
to intimidate people so that they can win the election -- for 
this reason there is no hope of a free and fair election in 
South Africa -- no hope. 
  For this reason I want to tell the state president: Sir, it 
is this constitution, it is this political dispensation he is 
busy with, it is these revolutionaries setting South Africa 
alight, and for this reason it is his duty to postpone this 
election because there will not be a free and fair election in 
South Africa, because there is still no solution. [applause] 
There still is no solution for South Africa. Sir, there is no 
solution, no dispensation which will bring peace. 
  Sir, I want to ask why the Goldstone Commission is not 
investigating these evil plans of the South African Communist 
Party. Why is it not investigating ... [pauses] Sir, in this 
document it is clearly stated: //The struggle against the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] in Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area must be intensified and it is 
taking place at this very moment. It is taking place.// But Mr. 
Chairman, the Goldstone Commission is not investigating this 
intensification of violence in Natal. No, he is keeping himself 
busy by discrediting honorable policemen, against whom no 
charges were laid. 
  Mr. Chairman, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei have already been 
destabilized. Now the charge is against kwaZulu and the 
question is Sir: The Goldstone Commission was responsible for 
this on two occasions -- for the destruction of the South 
African Defense Force and the South African Police's top 
management structure. Since 1992 a few hundred police and army 
officers, ranked as Colonels and higher, have been removed from 
the structures in this manner and the top structure has thus 
been destabilized. For this reason Mr. Chairman, not one of 
these men were ever found guilty. A legal, tested, valid 
complaint has not been lodged against any of them, but these 
things are happening, and the question now: Is it not time for 
the Goldstone Commission to be investigated for its role in 
South Africa. [applause] 
  Mr. Chairman, with this unfolding communist onslaught and 
threat to South Africa, the time has come for each person today 
to finally choose if he will resist this, if the Afrikaner 
nation will rise up, or if it will allow this takeover to take 
root. 
  For this reason, Sir, I want to say that the decision does 
not only rest with every farmer, it does not only rest with 
every housewife or every mother, it rests with every security 
force member in South Africa, it rests with every state official 
in South Africa. It is every worker in South Africa who will 
have to decide if we are to be led to the slaughter in this new 
South Africa, or if we will enforce our own free, rightful 
homeland in South Africa. 
  Sir, these men who marched a short while ago are the BC 
[Boer 
Commando] who were formed over a long period as a result of the 
suppression of the agricultural sector and as a result of the 
general security threat increasing in intensity. These men will 
not kneel down to communist domination and we say to these men: 
We stand with you. We will, together with you, not kneel down. 
These men have continually contributed to the expansion of the 
security system of this country and still forms the backbone of 
this system. They come from within the nation to the defense of 
the entire nation and in solidarity with our people in our 
cities. From Monday we will arrange for facilities to be made 
available at our National Front's head office, concerning 
registration of members of our nation who are prepared and 
willing to join this well-disciplined organization. 
  Mr. Chairman, every fellow countryman has now reached a 
crossroads. The choice is either freedom in the homeland or 
subjection in the new South Africa. That is the choice we have, 
Sir, and I say everyone must choose because one must ask the 
question, what is the fate of the policeman, the soldier, the 
civil servant, the worker, the farmer, the entrepreneur in the 
new South Africa? Mrs. Winnie Mandela said last week at 
Virginia: //The ANC will give priority to its supporters when it 
provides jobs after the April election. We will prioritize for 
our comrades. We are going to provide employment for all of 
you, starting with the comrades who served in prison for our 
(?cause).// Starting with the comrades, Sir, that is the 
situation facing our people, our workers. Not merit, not 
dedication, not skill, but //comrades who served in prisons in 
the cause of the South African Communist Party.// 
  Let me show you how this has been applied in Zimbabwe. In 
Zimbabwe there are now 26 permanent secretaries who are heads of 
departments. There are no whites among them. There are 73 
deputy secretaries, 3 of them whites. There are 147 under 
secretaries, with only 11 whites. Twenty-four ambassadors, not 
one of them white. 
  Job security, pensions... If there are people in South 
Africa today who ought to be concerned about their pensions, it 
is the civil servants. If there are people who have the right 
to demand the payment of their pensions -- and an ANC-SACP 
government has promised that they will use the pension funds for 
job creation -- then it is our people, those who will be losing 
their jobs, whose pensions will be used. They have the right to 
demand that their pensions be paid out. 
  Mr. Chairman, double standards are being applied. Our people 
who are in prison are not granted amnesty, but APLA [Azanian 
People's Liberation Army] and MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of 
the Nation; ANC military wing] members who are responsible for 
murder and terrorism, who are destabilizing Natal against the 
IFP and others, they are granted amnesty. 
  So, we say the Afrikaner nation is demanding that their 
people be granted amnesty, and that they be either charged or 
released. 
  Mr. Chairman, we choose the path of freedom in a homeland. 
We are not taking anything from anyone. We have had the lion's 
share in the building of this country, and we will not establish 
our homeland through anarchy. We have never been the aggressor, 
but we will defend our freedom and all that is justly ours. 
Sir, we prefer that the solution in South Africa be a peaceful 
one, but we will not allow ourselves to be forced into surrender 
by violence. 
  The Afrikaner has not lived selfishly in this country. We 
control the production of food. The civil service cannot 
function without the Afrikaner Boer nation. The factories and 
the mines cannot function without the Afrikaner Boer nation. 
The security forces cannot function without the Afrikaner Boer 
nation. So we demand that we be accommodated. We will not be 
satisfied with anything less than our rightful freedom and 
self-determination. If we are not accommodated, if we are 
pressured, we will not be the ones responsible for the chaos 
which will ensue. It will be those who are pressuring us. We 
will never bow to the communists. 
  Mr. Chairman, we have established our representative council 
to plan, coordinate, and act on behalf of our people. We are in 
the process of creating civic councils. These comprise one 
council with serving councillors elected by our people, and in 
areas where we do not have representation other people will be 
appointed. Their task will be to attend to the safety of our 
people because we are aware of the domino effect. First it was 
Bophuthatswana, then Ciskei, now it is kwaZulu's turn. The 
Afrikaner nation is next to be forced into submission through 
violence. So it will be the task of the civic councils to 
defend our people, to ensure that our taxes are used for the 
benefit of our people. If voters have problems, these must be 
attended to. Pressure must be exercised on the National Party 
and other councils to see that they act in the interests of the 
voters, and to set up civic councils in every town. A number of 
these councils are present here today -- Pretoria, 
Bronkhorstspruit, Brits, Breyten, Akasia, Verwoerdburg, 
Hartbeespoort, and others. 
  Our next task has to do with the voice of our people, Radio 
Pretoria. I ask you, do you accept responsibility for the voice 
of our people? Do you accept responsibility for its 
maintenance? Do you demand that that voice be heard? What is 
the answer? Do you demand it? It has been established with our 
money, with our skills. We did not ask for anything from anyone. 
  Our next step is to set up a security advisory council to 
see 
to the overall safety of our people. 
  We have adopted a constitution for our homeland. A 
constitution is not merely a document detailing a state's 
management structure. It is a living document which expresses a 
nation's character, its being, its deepest convictions, 
traditions, symbols, and ideals. That is why the French 
Constitution is different from the Germans. That is why our 
constitution differs from that of the new South Africa. The 
major features of our constitution are its commitment to 
Christianity, with the recognition of the freedom of religion; 
Afrikaans and English as official languages; a republican form 
of state; a national assembly consisting of representatives 
directly elected in general elections; a state president and 
executive council; independent courts; two levels of government 
consisting of the national assembly and the local council; 
citizenship for members of the Boer Afrikaner nation; 
citizenship as a precondition for the right to vote. 
Noncitizens are protected under international law and the bill 
of rights and duties contained in the constitution. Special 
majorities are needed to amend the constitution, and 51 percent 
of the members of the national assembly may call a referendum to 
amend the constitution. Disqualification of members of the 
assembly who act in defiance of their election mandate. The 
maintenance of the free market system. The right to private 
property [words indistinct] the flag and Die Stem [The Voice -- 
present national anthem]. 
  In order to maintain good relations with other nations, we 
seek a confederal system involving economic cooperation and 
political independence. 
  Mr. Chairman, I now move to the important matter of the 
right 
of the Afrikaner people to land in South Africa. Nations become 
independent on their own territory. Between the Second World 
War and the late eighties no nation became independent, no new 
state emerged. But since the nineties one new state after 
another has come into being because nations are becoming free in 
their own territory. 
  We have asked for a referendum to determine where the 
Afrikaners are who wish to be included in a homeland, and where 
those are who do not wish to be included in that homeland. That 
was the democratic way of doing things, but it was denied us. 
So we conducted our own surveys to determine the will of the 
people, and today we indicate to you soft borders -- not final 
borders -- of where our people wish to have their state. In all 
four provinces of South Africa people have indicated their 
desire to be part of a homeland. I say to you there are already 
parts of South Africa which belong to other peoples, which are 
independent states, self-governing states. There is also 
farming and urban land belonging to colored and Indian people. 
Those areas are not part of the Afrikaner Boer nation's land. 
There are also parts of the country which are already occupied 
by other nations, for example the urban areas around Pretoria, 
around Johannesburg. We do not lay claim to those areas. Then 
there are some of our people who have indicated that they do not 
want to be part of the homeland. Those are the people like Carl 
Niehaus of the ANC and Dawie de Villiers of the National Party. 
We do not wish to force them to become part of our homeland. 
We know they choose the new South Africa. To them we say, we 
grant you the new South Africa, but do not force it upon us, and 
we are only to eager to get rid of that baggage. 
  Mr. Chairman, our surveys have shown that the people of 
Natal, for example -- with the exception of northern Natal -- 
have said they do not wish to be part of the new South Africa; 
they want to share a new dispensation with the Zulus. The 
people of northern Natal have indicated that they wish to become 
part of a homeland. That matter will be negotiated with the Zulu 
nation. 
  But the Afrikaner Boer nation has an indisputable right to 
the internationally recognized Boer Republics of the Transvaal 
and the Orange Free State. We demand that right. It is our 
inalienable right. So with the exception of those areas which 
do not belong to us, and with the exception of those areas 
already occupied by other nations, as I indicated, and with the 
exception of those areas such as Johannesburg, whose people 
showed no desire in being part of this new republic of ours... 
Mr. Chairman, outside these historical areas there are large 
concentrations of Afrikaners, such as in the Cape Province, who 
have an age-old right to be part of our homeland. Just as there 
are people within the two historical republics who do not want 
to be part of the homeland, so too there are people in the Cape 
Province who want to be part of it. We say -- and our people 
have already decided so -- that Pretoria was historically the 
capital of the Afrikaner nation, and therefore it must be the 
capital of the Afrikaner nation's homeland. 
  In spite of reports in the newspapers, the majority of the 
people of Pretoria showed in the survey that they wish to be 
part of the Boer Republic. It is also a fact that in those 
areas outside the homeland where people have said they do not 
want to be a part of the homeland, one finds a minority of our 
compatriots who also want to be part of the homeland, but the 
overriding opinion of the communities there are against it. So 
what is their position? We believe they can be citizens of our 
state, and just as the Jewish nation has a refuge, Afrikaners 
around the world will have a refuge. They can embrace this 
homeland. We can serve them, we can negotiate on their behalf. 
We are going to maintain first-world standards in our homeland, 
and Afrikaners will have a refuge there. 
  We seek permanent peace and a permanent, peaceful solution 
for South Africa. But there is no such thing. It is not in the 
constitution, it is not on the negotiating table. Chaos is 
increasing. We want a permanent, peaceful solution. Matthew 
Chapter 5, Verse 9, reads: Blessed are the peacemakers, for 
they shall be called the children of God. What does the present 
constitution offer? It was drawn up by communists, its drafting 
was dominated by communists. It is a constitution for 
communists which totally rejects the authority of God, so we say 
it is not our duty to respect that which they have created. 
They are responsible for the chaos. Our task is to bring down 
the authority of the anti-Christ. Matthew Chapter 5, Verse 11 
reads: Blessed are you who are reviled and persecuted for my 
sake. That is why the Afrikaner has his back to the wall. The 
Afrikaner is not prepared to surrender his freedom. 
  Mr. Chairman, this constitution carries the germ of 
destruction. Wars are waged over land. Wars are waged over 
ethnicity. Wars are waged over religion. This constitution does 
not provide for these things. It does not provide land for our 
people or for others. It does not provide for the 
self-determination of peoples. It does not provide for us to 
serve our God in our own land. Provision must be made for this 
before there can be peace. And not only for our people. Our 
people and the Zulus want their freedom; others have been forced 
into submission. Our demands must be accommodated in order that 
there be peace in South Africa. 
  The final solution will not be achieved overnight, because 
they are moving in the wrong direction. If the rights of others 
to govern themselves are recognized, the stranglehold will ease 
and South Africa will achieve peace. We know we will again be 
free; when and how depends on the nation. We have gathered here 
today to demonstrate that our desire remains unchanged. We have 
demonstrated here today that we are continuing along the road to 
freedom, to self-determination in our own homeland. 
  Throughout the history of our struggle for freedom we know 
that no other nation has ever come to our assistance. Our 
people have always had only one refuge to turn to, and that has 
been the King of Kings. We seek no enmity with any nation or 
country, but we commit ourselves today irrevocably to the Holy 
Trinity. We know that, as in the past, under God's guidance, 
our people will arrive in our homeland, free under our own flag, 
as a free nation, to serve our Creator. 
  I ask you all, friends, that we accept this declaration of 
intent. We, as representatives of the Boer Afrikaner nation 
gathered here today, believe totally that God the Holy Trinity 
determines the fate of nations and therefore our fate. And 
because we believe, in accordance with internationally accepted 
norms and principles, that it is the God-given right of every 
nation and therefore our nation's right to be free; and because 
we are convinced that peace can only be assured if every 
peace-loving nation is allowed to govern itself; and because the 
Boer Afrikaner nation will never accept subjection, enslavement, 
or tyranny from any foreign authority; and because the nation is 
determined, with all the means at its disposal, even with its 
blood, to restore its freedom in its own fatherland: Therefore 
we declare here and now that it is our firm intention, if 
allowed, to peacefully govern ourselves before 27 April 1994 in 
our own8independent state through the structures already created 
for that purpose. 
  But at the same time, if we are not allowed to declare the 
freedom of the Boer Afrikaner nation in a peaceful manner, we 
commit ourselves, and undertake hereby, to reestablish and 
confirm the freedom of the Boer Afrikaner nation with whatever 
means at our disposal, against anyone who threatens the freedom 
of the nation or in any way whatsoever attempts to interfere 
with it. We declare this for and on behalf of the Afrikaner 
nation. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise [words indistinct] 
support me in this undertaking [words in distinct] attach it to 
the front door of the Old Council Chamber where our nation's 
government met, and where our nation's government will again 
meet in the future. I thank you.
