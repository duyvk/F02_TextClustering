<P>
Under the militant banner of "spiritual warfare," growing numbers of 
evangelical and charismatic Christian leaders are preparing broad assaults on 
what they call the cosmic powers of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinated with the notion that Satan commands a hierarchy of territorial 
demons, some mission agencies and big-church pastors are devising strategies 
for "breaking the strongholds" of those evil spirits alleged to be controlling 
cities and countries. 
</P>
<P>
Some proponents in the fledgling movement already maintain that focused prayer 
meetings have ended the curse of the Bermuda Triangle, led to the 1987 downfall 
in Oregon of free-love guru Baghwan Shree Rajneesh and, for the 1984 Summer 
Olympics in Los Angeles, produced a two-week drop in the crime rate, a friendly 
atmosphere and unclogged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the cinematic story line for a religious sequel to "Ghostbusters 
II," yet the developing scenario does have a fictional influence; interest in 
spiritual warfare has been heightened by two best-selling novels at Christian 
bookstores. "This Present Darkness," by Frank Peretti, describes the religious 
fight against "territorial spirits mobilized to dominate a small town." A 
second novel by Peretti has a similar premise. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller Seminary Prof. C. Peter Wagner, who has written extensively on the 
subject, led a "summit" meeting on cosmic-level spiritual warfare Monday in 
Pasadena with two dozen men and women, including a Texas couple heading a group 
called the "Generals of Intercession" and an Oregon man who conducts "spiritual 
warfare boot camps." 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Wagner said: "The (Holy) Spirit is saying something to 
churches through these (Peretti) books even though they are fiction. People are 
reading these books that would never read our books." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to segments of Christianity that think of the devil as a biblical-era 
representation of evil not too credible or useful today, theologically 
conservative churches virtually assume that Satan is a real, active being in 
the world. Moreover, in Pentecostal and charismatic churches -- where speaking 
in tongues, healing and other supernatural "gifts of the Holy Spirit" are 
practiced -- some clergy conduct "deliverance ministries" in which they claim 
to exorcise personal demons. 
</P>
<P>
But clergy exploring high-level spiritual warfare point to the Letter to the 
Ephesians, among other biblical sources, for their marching orders against 
"world rulers of this present darkness." Some say they have discerned the names 
of the ruling princes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, caution was expressed at the Pasadena meeting for several 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ridicule from the outside world and by more moderate churchgoers is one 
concern. "I don't want to get so far out that they think I'm L. Ron Hubbard," 
said the Rev. Dick Bernal of San Jose, referring to the late science fiction 
writer and Scientology founder. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exciting," the pastor added. "But what's flaky, what's believable, 
what's scriptural?" Bernal's own literature, however, appears more confident -- 
suggesting that an evil prince over part of the United States "is a religious 
spirit who keeps people bound up in useless traditions" and giving directions 
for removing a curse on a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Another cause for caution, said Wagner, is the danger involved: "If you do not 
know what you are doing, and few . . . have the necessary expertise, Satan will 
eat you for breakfast." As a means of protection against the demonic while they 
met for eight hours Monday at Lake Avenue Congregational Church, organizers 
arranged for a comparable number of relatives and friends to pray continuously 
in a nearby room. 
</P>
<P>
A third concern, barely aired at the Pasadena conference, is whether other 
cultures are defamed with the suggestion that only evangelical Christianity is 
free of demonic influence. 
</P>
<P>
Demons were also blamed for the growth of New Age beliefs, the spread of 
illegal drugs, pornography "and the militant force of the Islamic movement" by 
Tom White of Corvallis, Ore., a conference participant who conducts what he 
calls spiritual warfare boot camps for local churches. 
</P>
<P>
One disagreement over strategy was apparent. White has questioned whether the 
Bible or the church today dictates a "holy crusade" seeking out evil presences. 
"We do not go looking for this level of battle, but we let it find us," he 
said. But John Dawson of Los Angeles, Southwest director for Youth With a 
Mission, recommends the offensive. "We need to overcome the enemy before we 
employ other methods of ministry among people," Dawson wrote in his book, 
"Taking Our Cities for God." 
</P>
<P>
God, it was suggested at the close of the meeting, endorsed the offensive 
strategy. Nearly all conferees laced their comments with something "that God 
told me," but Dawson's mother, Bible teacher Joy Dawson of Tujunga, said God 
had revealed seven principles to her at 4:30 a.m. that same day. The final 
point was the importance of being on the offense -- "not waiting for the enemy 
to attack," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The demon-fighting strategists in Pasadena included several who had taken part 
in a series of spiritual warfare workshops last July in Manila at a major 
gathering on world evangelization. The Pasadena meeting featured executives 
Samuel Kamaleson and John Robb of World Vision International in Monrovia as 
well as representatives of various evangelical mission agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Another conferee, Pastor Jack Hayford of the large Church on the Way in Van 
Nuys, told participants Monday that he has been interested since 1973 in 
"confrontation with the demonic." 
</P>
<P>
Hayford, a low-key Pentecostal preacher widely admired beyond his own Four 
Square Gospel denomination, is also the originator of the now quarterly "Love 
L.A." prayer meetings. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 pastors and church workers attended the fourth such prayer session 
Tuesday at Hollywood First Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
The stated purposes are merely to pray for each other and for solutions to the 
city's problems, but spokesmen acknowledged this week that "spiritual warfare" 
on behalf of Los Angeles is part of the reason for the three-hour meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Prayers were said Tuesday morning for the homeless, drug addicts and abused 
children and against abortion, pornography and other societal ills, according 
the Rev. Scott Bauer, an associate pastor at Church on the Way. "Demons were 
certainly mentioned," Bauer said, citing New Testament references. 
</P>
<P>
But Bauer and the host pastor for the prayer meetings, the Rev. Lloyd John 
Ogilvie, emphasized in separate interviews that the main purpose was to make an 
interracial, interdenominational show of mutual support. 
</P>
<P>
"The cliche, 'We need each other,' has lost its purely sentimental appeal and 
becomes a deeper, more profound reality," said the Rev. Donn Moomaw, pastor of 
Bel Air Presbyterian Church, in endorsing the prayer marathons. 
</P>
<P>
But the cosmic, darkness-fighting dimension of the meetings was cited by other 
clergy, including Bishop Charles E. Blake of the Church of God in Christ, 
Raymundo Diaz Jr. of Angelus Temple and Dennis N. Baker, general director of 
the Conservative Baptist Assn. of Southern California.
