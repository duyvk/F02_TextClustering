US TRADE officials yesterday praised the revised offers to liberalise both
goods and services trade recently tabled in the Uruguay Round, and expressed
optimism about the likelihood of getting a Uruguay Round deal finished by
the December 15 deadline.
'The Uruguay Round will not fail,' said Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy trade
representative. 'The US feels upbeat about the range and level of
commitments that countries will take at the end of the day.'
Speaking separately yesterday, Mr John Schmidt, the Uruguay Round
co-ordinator, said thorny relations between the US and EC were 'mostly a
passing phenomenon'. However, he said the EC's offer to reduce semiconductor
tariffs from 14 per cent to 7 was insufficient and its market access offer
on agriculture would actually reduce access.
Mr Schmidt said the US would continue to resist an EC 'fixation' that the US
reduce all of its textile tariff peaks - those over 15 per cent  - although
it would reduce many.
The US must have changes in the negotiating text in the areas of
anti-dumping, investment, and health and food rules. This procedure will
begin on November 15, when the Trade Negotiating Committee begins meeting
virtually in continuous session.
He also urged negotiation of a larger market access package than the
'minimal' deal agreed at the Tokyo economic summit. Australia needs a zero
tariff pact in non-ferrous metals; the Asean countries, in electronics; and
Sweden and Switzerland, in scientific instruments.
