statement on Iraqi Television on 15 March: "Al-Sahhaf: 
Resolution 706 Contains Traps and Snares To Shackle Iraq and To 
Continue Imposing the Blockade; There Is a Treacherous Game in 
Applying the Resolutions Aimed At Avoiding Fulfillment of 
Obligations"] 
  [Text] Iraqi Television last night carried an interview 
with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf in which he 
reviewed the provisions of the resolutions which were issued by 
the UN Security Council, Iraq's position on them, and the lack 
of any justifications for these resolutions now that Iraq has 
fulfilled its obligations. 
  The minister remarked that this subject needs to be 
explained 
and clarified in detail in view of the conspiracies and intrigue 
which the enemies of Iraq and Arabdom have woven around it. 
  The minister said: Let me begin by pointing out very briefly 
that Resolution (687) was passed on 3 April 1991 after being 
submitted by the henchmen of the imperialist powers. There were 
16 drafts before the resolution was finally put to a vote. Some 
12 member states voted for the resolution. Cuba, which was 
daring and courageous, voted against it. Two other 
non-permanent member states; Ecuador and Yemen, abstained. Some 
member states, such as China and others, gave their vote for the 
resolution, but they also explained their position on it and 
contested some of its provisions. 
  The minister added: The resolution has a preamble and 34 
operative paragraphs. It is a long, complicated resolution and 
its operative paragraphs are purposely divided into 9 sections, 
of which Section (C) is the axis. The leader president had 
dealt with this section in his [13 March] speech. The 
resolution was passed on 3 April, and on 6 April Iraq nofied the 
Security Council of its frank and clear position on it in a 
long, precise message based on the principles of international 
law and the UN Charter. Iraq dealt with all those paragraphs, 
explaining how they conflicted with the principles of 
international law. Iraq concluded its message -- and it is 
important that I mention this -- by citing the words of its then 
Foreign Minister Professor Ahmad Husayn: "While recording these 
principled, legal, and legitimate observations, Iraq appeals to 
men of free conscience among the members of the international 
community and world public opinion to understand the truth as it 
is and to support justice as they should. Iraq has found itself 
faced with one choice only, which is to accept this resolution." 
We then requested that our message be distributed as a document 
of the Security Council, and this was done. 
  The minister added: The purpose was to establish our legal 
and legitimate position which was based on the UN Charter and 
the principles of international law so that our rights would not 
be lost even if we had to accept the resolution under the 
existing circumstances. 
  Al-Sahhaf said: The second remark I would like to make -- 
and this is very important also -- is that on line three of its 
preamble, Resolution (687) affirms the member states' commitment 
to defending Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
political independence. But no sooner had they mentioned this 
sentence than they went about violating it in several paragraphs 
of the same resolution. Several paragraphs conflict with this 
basic principle on which international society is founded. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf pointed out that he had to make 
this 
remark so people will fully comprehend the unfair general 
blockade which is being imposed on Iraq. The minister said: 
Resolution (661), which was issued on 6 August 1990, explained 
why the unjust blockade was imposed. It was imposed because 
Iraq did not approve Resolution (660) which was issued on 2 
August 1990. What does Resolution (660) say? Resolution (660) 
has two paragraphs providing for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, 
calling on Iraq and Kuwait to sit together to solve their 
problems, and noting that the Security Council welcomed all 
efforts being exerted, including those of the Arab League, to 
achieve this aim. 
  The minister said: Later, Iraq approved all the resolutions; 
namely, 660, 661, and so forth. Still, the Security Council did 
not fulfill its obligations. So they came and drafted this 
resolution [687], thus "swallowing up" all their previous 
resolutions on the one hand, and producing new conditions and a 
new situation which only exposes the real aims of the whole 
aggression against Iraq. 
  The minister added: Everyone in our society must know how 
matters were twisted at every stage and the purpose behind doing 
so. Resolution (687) has 34 operative paragraphs. The preamble 
refers to Iraq's political independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity only as a formality. The preamble also 
includes certain principles which were carefully selected by 
those who drafted the resolution in order to serve as a 
background and a basis for the operative paragraphs which, in 
themselves, are a gross violation of international law and the 
UN Charter in particular. 
  The minister said: The key point of Resolution (687), to 
which the leader president referred in his speech, is Section 
(C). This section includes Paragraphs (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 
13). Paragraph (14) is an explanation saying if Paragraphs 7-13 
are applied successfully to Iraq, it would the beginning of 
their application to the entire Middle East to turn it into a 
zone free of weapons of mass destruction. They have not yet 
done anything on this score. 
  The minister said: Regarding Section (C), which includes the 
paragraphs I just mentioned, they said: We know that you Iraqis 
have weapons of mass destruction. These weapons exist in the 
following fields: the nuclear field, the chemical field, the 
biological field, and the delivery systems field; that is 
missiles. They also said: We have Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 
12, and 13 to apply and we will set up a UN Special Commission 
for that. There is also the International Agency for Atomic 
Energy, which specializes in these matters. The Special 
Commission and the agency have been instructed to work out a 
plan with you. You will tell them the weapons and missiles you 
have. Teams from the Special Commission and the agency will 
come to inspect them, and the existing arsenal will be 
destroyed. We will inspect the sites where you manufactured and 
installed the machines and plants which produce these weapons. 
We will remove parts of these machines so that they would no 
longer be able to produce chemical weapons or missiles with a 
range of more than 150 km. 
  The minister added: They wanted us to reveal all that we had 
and to destroy it. They wanted us to destroy the weapons, which 
were banned under the provisions of this resolution, and also 
the machines and factories connected with their production. 
Once these steps were taken, Iraq would have nothing left and 
would be in no position to produce anything. 
  The minister said: They said: But in order to make sure that 
you Iraqis -- and we know you are a clever and dynamic people -- 
will not go back to producing these weapons, we will set up a 
future monitoring system. They mentioned in Section (C) of 
Resolution (687) that the monitoring system would last for one 
year. 
  The minister said: Since they accepted the resolution, one 
would presume that based their acceptance on the principles of 
law, international relations, and the UN Charter, meaning, 
first, that whatever they requested under Section (C) would not 
prejudice Iraq's national sovereignty and independence, its 
ability for development, and its right to self-determination, 
which are basic for any society and country. We presumed that 
our dealing began on the basis of the provisions and principles 
I mentioned. 
  The minister added: We have been following Section (C) since 
the cease-fire in 1991. The leader president said: Tell us 
what you want so we can sit together, discuss it, and destroy 
some machines and plants to make them unserviceable. And in 
order to reassure everyone we will also set up a monitoring 
system. This has been going on since 1991. We did more than we 
promised. For the sake of precision and to prove to our people, 
I will mention some of the documents which we deposited with the 
United Nations and which are now considered documents of the 
Security Council. They asked us to begin with the nuclear field 
first, and we did. They said we want Iraq to announce its 
commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty, we said: Fine, we 
have the following: six letters which were sent by the foreign 
minister containing Iraq's adherence to the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 16 messages and statements 
confirming that Iraq does not possess nuclear weapons and that 
it does not produce these weapons or any substance that goes 
into their production, 62 letters containing Iraqi declarations 
on nuclear positions, and 23 nuclear teams. Then they said: 
Tell us about the components of the Iraqi nuclear program. We 
told them what we had: 547 tonnes of natural uranium [yuraniyum 
tabi'i] and 50 kgs of highly enriched fuel. They took them and 
transported them outside Iraq. We said also that we had 1,850 
kgs of a fairly enriched uranium, 6 kgs of plutonium for 
scientific research, and 6 tonnes of uranium waste. That was 
all. 
  They carried out a thorough inspection. Then, they said: 
We want to know the stages of your nuclear program. So, we 
told them that our stages are as follows: Extraction of uranium 
from ore and its transformation into uranium compounds. We have 
electromagnetics, chemicals, and central [word indistinct]. All 
this is for research. We also process fuels. This framework, 
as you can see, is very normal. We have nuclear reactors we 
bought from you. We have an electro-nuclear power project, 
plants to retrieve depleted (wasted) nuclear fuel, and a plant 
for the treatment of radioactive waste. We have scientific 
research efforts that are connected to the program. Our 
position is the same as that of any other nation or state that 
is conducting research. It is all scientific research for use 
in medicine and agriculture, as part of the development 
programs. Finally, we have agricultural and medical 
applications, to which we have already referred. Of course, we 
have a nuclear safety system, nuclear safety measures, and the 
engineering support for them. 
  The minister said: They saw and thoroughly inspected what we 
had. Talks with [UN chief inspector] Ekeus began in July 1993. 
They continued in September, October, and November of that year, 
and in New York, as well. In his capacity as the representative 
of the International Agency for Atomic Energy, he wrote -- we 
have the document because it is a now Security Council document 
-- saying: There are no more secrets in the Iraqi program. Iraq 
has approved Resolution 715 concerning permanent monitoring. We 
believe Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations. 
  The minister said: Regarding the chemical field, we followed 
the same line. We told them what we have. I will mention some 
figures, because we have them in our records and they are also 
documented with the Security Council. 
  The minister continued: Some 12 large chemical inspection 
teams came, under Paragraph 9 of Section C, to see the records, 
visit the sites, and obtain samples. We detailed our stockpile: 
10,780 pieces of missile hardware ['atad sawarikh] for 122-mm 
missiles, 1,776 shells [qanbarah], 12,634 artillery shells, 30 
al-Husayn missile warheads and 2,000 mortar shells. We said you 
can visit the sites where this hardware is produced, and the 
development laboratories, as well. They inspected them. Then 
they asked: Where are the simple materials [al-mawad 
al-basitah]? We told them that the stockpile of active 
materials [al-mawad al-'awamil] is 280 tonnes, and the simple 
materials stockpile is 75 tonnes. They asked to see the 
canisters. We told them here are 45,000 canisters for 122-mm 
missiles and 5,000 shells for 250-mm missiles, and here are the 
24,000 that were destroyed in the bombing. They were all 
destroyed in the bombing. They saw it all, including the scrap 
metal. Then, they began inspecting. Later, they said: We want 
to see the documents. 
  The minister added: We gave them the nuclear documents, 
which totaled more than 60,000 pages. Then they asked for the 
documents on chemical weapons. We told them they were destroyed 
in the bombing. Then they told us: We want you to remember 
everything and write it down on paper. Iraqi experts exerted 
great efforts and wrote down everything in order to eliminate 
any excuse. Ekeus wrote on a piece of paper: I find this to be 
satisfactory, meeting all requirements. Ekeus then heard the 
statements by the official in charge of the Iraqi and Gulf 
Section in the U.S. State Department and by the U.S. National 
Security Council adviser. He became suspicious after hearing 
these statements, although we had a signed document between us 
in which he said that what he saw was satisfactory and met all 
requirements. 
  When he heard those people speaking in this way, he decided 
that he wanted more information and that what we had given him 
was not enough. Some 12 large chemical teams came. They left 
nothing unearthed. They analyzed water and soil. They carried 
out air inspections. They were very provocative, but the Iraqis 
restrained themselves and remained very patient. The behavior 
of the others was really bad and provocative. 
  The minister said: Iraq did not have anything in the 
biological field. Actually, what we had was just scientific 
research. We did not have any secrets. The so-called 
reinforced microbes [mikrubat mujahhadah] were purchased from 
the United States for purely scientific research, not for 
biochemical weapons. Several experts came and saw them. Then 
they said: We want to see the laboratories, even in those in 
Iraqi universities. They also asked if there were any private 
sector laboratories. 
  Regarding the missiles, we told them: This is what we have. 
Here are the al-Husayn missiles. Here are the Scuds we got from 
the Russians. We gave them details. During this period, they 
brought in 21 teams, if not more, consisting of missile 
specialists. 
  The minister said: The United States continued to play the 
same tune, i.e., that Iraq hid some missiles. So, they launched 
a new search campaign. I call it a search campaign, not an 
inspection campaign. They brought in helicopters and gamma ray 
spectrometers to discover what Iraq might have hidden 
underground. They then toured the country. They stayed for 
several weeks. The American lie was exposed. 
  The minister added: Finally, they asked for the records 
about the disposal of missiles. We gave them the records. Then 
they said: We want to see if these documents are original or 
recent. They brought in a team to inspect the documents. Then 
they said: The documents are original, but we will take them to 
Europe for further inspection by more sensitive instruments, 
although we are sure they are original. We will take them to 
inspect them. We patiently said: Take them. Then we said: 
Fine, we have covered all fields under Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11, 12, and 13 of Section C. Nothing has been left uninspected. 
  I will now mention how far they have gone in their behavior. 
They said: We want to go to the southern marshlands, because we 
received information about possible leftover chemical weapons 
that were used there. We said: This is very ridiculous. They 
said: Still, we must go. We took them to the south. They wore 
protective suits against chemical weapons. They were flat on 
the ground while helicopters hovered over their heads. They 
located an object stuck into ground. They walked over 
cautiously, tied a rope round it, fearing it might explode. 
When they pulled it out it turned out to be used mortar shell. 
I still remember how some of them shook their heads shamefully, 
and others said: These people -- meaning the Americans -- are 
making a mockery of us. 
  The minister said: We knew right from the start that it was 
an intentional thing. This was one of hundreds, if not 
thousands, of examples that Iraqis have patiently endured since 
1991. 
  The minister added: You may not have heard some of the 
remarks made about the Ministry of Agriculture, which turned out 
to be theatrical, since they did not find any of the things they 
claimed were inside the Ministry. Actually, there was nothing 
in the Ministry. But since they had nothing to say, they wrote 
in their report: We found in one of the rooms "a scratch" on a 
wall caused by a chair. Apparently, the employee using this 
particular chair placed it against the wall, causing the 
scratch. They said in the report: We saw the chair but its 
back was not as high as the scratch. So, it was not the chair 
that caused scratch. This means the chair that made the scratch 
was replaced. They included that in the report as evidence. 
The report was referred to the UN Security Council. You know 
how tense relations were with the Security Council, which wanted 
any justification in order to deceive the world about the 
aggressive threats being made by peoples' hangmen. 
  The minister said: As you can see, I am only citing examples 
and completely avoiding any personal comment. I dealt with this 
person, Ekeus, right from the start. I recall that during our 
meeting together during his last visit here in February 1994, we 
asked him certain specific questions. I asked him: Why this 
delay? What more is asked of us? We explained what we have. 
You also know what we destroyed. I also gave you figures. 
Then they said they wanted whatever we mentioned in writing. 
They said: Actually, we saw the destroyed ammunition, and the 
picture you presented to us was clear, but please remember 
everything and put it down in writing. They wanted us to sit 
down, remember everything, and commit it to writing. We had to 
think and remember what happened in a certain month or a certain 
year, what empty shell, magazine, or simple weapon was used, and 
for what purpose. 
  The minister said: Iraqi technicians sat down and very 
patiently searched their brains so as to eliminate any excuse. 
They produced a full record for Ekeus. He was astonished by 
the results. He said: What you have written down from memory is 
sufficient and meets the purpose. We recorded it in our joint 
minutes. But the Western henchmen said it was not enough. We 
could not accept their haphazard remarks. We told Ekeus: Sit 
down. You said the record was sufficient and met the purpose. 
Therefore, this change in attitude is politically motivated in 
order to prolong the blockade of Iraq. Some Western henchmen 
say this is not enough. To be honest, most members in the 
Security Council are against the extension of the blockade on 
Iraq, because they have begun to see the irrefutable facts. But 
the Americans are known for influencing and blackmailing others, 
and Ekeus knows that. During the last meeting in February 
regarding the monitoring, Gart [name as transliterated] produced 
a chart and reminded me of Resolution 706, which provides for 
exporting oil worth $1.6 billion. The world knows only that oil 
is to be exported. But it does not know the traps and snares 
inherent in this resolution designed to shackle Iraq. All these 
traps and snares are actually intended to make us approve the 
monitoring system details. 
  The minister said: Fine, you have worked out everything. 
Ekeus said: Well, I cannot say that. I said: Fine, why don't 
you find out? You have the Special Commission and the 
experience. You have used everything, including espionage 
aircraft. And now you say you do not know anything. How can 
that be? He said: We do not have the capability. I said: 
Fine, when the Americans wanted to support Iranian claims that 
Iraq used chemical weapons in the Gulf, you made a big uproar. 
A working team was immediately dispatched to the south. Fine, 
let us talk about monitoring. Iraq and its people have been 
very patient with you since 1991. Yet, you now say that you do 
not have the capability. This is unacceptable. We ask you, in 
fact, it is our right -- or, to be more precise, it is our 
minimum right -- to work out a timetable to apply to what 
remains, if you have something new to be monitored. Practically 
speaking, the monitoring began in December 1993, it is in 
progress, and the inspection cameras have been mounted at 
missile sites and nuclear establishments. The inspection teams 
also continue to operate in the factories. They even marked 
some machines with tape, saying they must not be used. Ekeus 
came to us saying: There are machines in some factories that 
must not be used until the monitoring system has been installed. 
So, he produced some tape and stuck it on the machines, 
although they are ordinary commercial machines that the Iraqi 
could have used for months. Tape was stuck on machines, cameras 
were installed in two places, to inspect missile engines and in 
the nuclear sector. Iraqi laboratories are under inspection and 
all the monitoring measures have been taken, yet Ekeus comes and 
says: But our capabilities are limited. This is an obvious 
lie. Its purpose is to waste time and to continue the blockade 
of the Iraqi people. We told Ekeus in February: This is our 
minimum right. We have been patient with you until now. 
  The minister said: We said let us work out a timetable. He 
evaded the subject. We pressed him. We held three meetings 
that continued for hours. But he prevaricated like a fox in the 
forest, as the leader president said. He said: We must have a 
protocol, or a record, for each factory specifying the type of 
monitoring being conducted in it. We should also set up logs. 
Although this was completely unacceptable, we told him: Let it 
be, although we are not 100-percent convinced that you have the 
capability. We know what your capabilities are. We know what 
the Americans have placed at your disposal. We ask you: How 
many Iraqi engineers and experts do you want? Two hundred? 
Take 200. They will help you accomplish your work quickly, 
according to this timetable. As far as we are concerned, we 
believe monitoring began in December 1993. Ekeus said: If I 
agreed to that, they would say I was cooperating with the 
Iraqis. What a weak excuse! So, he completely avoided 
committing himself to a timetable, which is our minimum right. 
  The minister said: The announcement should have been made 
in December 1993. But now that we are in this phase, let us 
respond to the one who brought up the fabrication, although the 
resolution clearly says that once Iraq has fulfilled its 
obligations in these fields there can be nothing left against 
it. It was Ekeus who came up with this prevarication. We do 
not know where he got it from. Monitoring began in December 
1993. The six-month period is a baseless fabrication. The 
resolution itself, as we have heard, spoke of one year. The 
leader president has proved this. The game has become only too 
clear, not just to the politicians, but to any citizen, 
observer, or anyone with an ordinary interest in this subject. 
He can see very clearly that there is a treacherous game that 
goes beyond this resolution. No matter what anyone might say, 
this resolution violates the entire UN Charter and the 
fundamentals of international law. The game has been completely 
exposed. Ekeus wanted to maintain the blockade on Iraq, so he 
looked for any excuse to avoid his obligations. That is quite 
obvious. 
  The minister added: As soon as the inspection teams began 
their work, we should have said that there was nothing left 
unfavorable to our country. But the mean, mean game has 
continued ever since. We have been very patient. I say this 
because we have, indeed, been very patient; in fact, too 
patient, about the enemy's own standards, assumptions, and 
violations of our sovereignty. These people are aggressors who 
resorted to any feeble excuse to implement the resolution their 
way. All these steps could have taken in the spring of 1992, 
but they wanted to continue injuring the Iraqi people, because 
they are the only people who said "no" to the entire 
imperialist-Zionist game. So, they have continued to play the 
fox in the forest to this day. Even now, they insist on what 
they are doing. I will mention some figures. You all recall 
the U.S. spy David Kay. He fabricated a crisis. Therefore, 
they issued Resolution 707, that included several paragraphs 
violating Iraq's sovereignty and independence. I will cite some 
of the provisions in this resolution. The provisions say the 
inspection teams have the right to intercept any car, ship, or 
plane; enter any house or place; storm any building; and 
completely freeze Iraqi rights, even with regard to medicine. 
Even isotopes needed for medicine were withheld from us. Yet, 
they say all Security Council states uphold Iraq's sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and political independence. 
  The minister continued: They imposed the no-fly zone in the 
South on 28 August. Before that, they imposed the no-fly zone 
in the North. From 28 August to 31 December 1993, the Americans 
violated Iraqi sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political 
independence 25,534 times; that is more than 10 times daily. 
There were days when there were 80 violations. This is in 
addition to dropping flares on fields from low-flying aircraft. 
Thousands of Iraqi women suffered abortions. Several diseases 
were caused. Many people's interests were disrupted. This was 
just during that period. But what did those who imposed this 
situation do? What did those who included in the resolution the 
sentence about member states upholding Iraq's independence, 
territorial integrity, and political independence do? They 
committed scores of violations daily. We have recorded 
everything. They have all been documented with the United 
Nations and even the Arab League. Let us now restrict our 
discussion to the Security Council and Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687, which represents the minimum Iraqi rights. As I 
said, the picture now in the Security Council is as follows: 
Those renegades who want continuation of the blockade on the 
Iraqi people are a minority in the council. The majority in the 
council, without mentioning names, call for the need to speed up 
the implementation of Paragraph 22. The majority includes some 
of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. They are 
also a majority within the five big powers; in fact, three of 
the big powers. What is taking place in the Security Council is 
a reflection of the international situation. I believe that to 
a large extent these changes are an expression of an 
international awakening, albeit slowly, to the big plot planned 
in the eighties and carried out against Iraq. The so-called new 
world order was aimed at Iraq and the world. The changes taking 
place in the Security Council are an expression of this 
comparatively slow awakening. We might be able to expedite this 
awakening. 
  The minister added: Tangible changes are definitely taking 
place in the Security Council. The reason is that Iraq has 
fulfilled all its obligations under this resolution, despite its 
unfairness. The so-called new world order has also been 
exposed. Iraqi blood was shed, but the Iraqis remained patient 
all this time. When the evil directed against Iraq began to 
affect others, the changes started. Everyone said: God help 
the Iraqis and give them patience. Yes, when the spark of fire 
began to reach others, they started asking questions: What is 
going on? They could not stand it. What can we say about the 
Iraqis who had to endure this for four years; who were hit by 
the equivalent of seven nuclear bombs? Iraq will soon enter the 
fourth year of the blockade. Indeed, the change has started. 
  The minister said: The leader president, may God preserve 
him, spoke about the nature of the mission of Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz. I have just spoken about general climate 
of this mission, which is very clear, documented, and founded on 
a basis that any sensible and logical person can understand and 
come to the same conclusion as the leader president, i.e., that 
the game has been exposed and Iraq is only demanding its rights 
under Paragraph 22; rights that should have been applied in the 
spring of 1992. The international situation now -- actually the 
change became evident in the last quarter of 1993 -- is very 
different from what it was on 3 April 1991. The resoluton was 
issued at an inadvertent moment in history, within the game, or 
plot, of the so-called new world order. They tried to establish 
something that conflicted with the nature of things in all parts 
of the world. So, their plans were deadlocked in 1992 and 1993 
and began to be exposed after the last quarter of 1993. 
  The minister explained: The international atmosphere now is 
clearly in favor of Iraqi rights. This inclination exists in 
the Security Council. As I said, the majority in the Security 
Council are demanding implementation of Paragraph 22. Their 
conscience is burdened by the Iraqi people's sufferings as a 
result of this despicable crime committed against them since the 
imposition of the blockade; in fact, since the issuance of 
Resolution 661 on 6 August 1990. The majority is making 
demands. There are divisions in the minority and even inside 
the United States itself. 
  The minister said: Actually, a significant debate took 
place within one of the subcommittees of the Congressional 
Foreign Relations Committee. The debate was between Committee 
Chairman Lee Hamilton, a Democrat and a Clinton supporter, and 
Assistant Secretary of State Pelletreau. The latter was U.S. 
ambassador to Tunisia during the initial contacts with the PLO. 
He was then transferred to the State Department. Pelletreau 
was summoned to testify before the committee. Hamilton himself 
put the questions to Pelletreau. He asked him: Tell me, what 
do you want from Iraq? Pelletreau tried to dodge the question, 
but Hamilton kept coming back with the same question, saying: 
You are not making it clear to me. I want you to say exactly 
what you want from Iraq. What is it that Iraq has not fulfilled 
and must fulfill before the blockade is lifted? Pelletreau 
replied: I believe it will be wise if I do not answer your 
question. The question was repeated ten times, but Pelletreau 
remained evasive. Hamilton then told him: Go now and come back 
after one or two weeks with a written reply. 
  The minister said: This shows that even inside the enemy map 
the atmosphere is no longer the same as the one they fabricated 
and presented in 1991. Yes, the situation is changing and will 
continue to change. We have all seen how world nations changed 
their attitude when spark from the fire that hit Iraq and the 
Iraqi people began reaching them. They stood up and said: This 
is unacceptable. 
  The foreign minister said: Iraqi rights will definitely be 
achieved. The arguments, evidence, and documents we have just 
outlined will silence the largest of them. Who will continue to 
be stubborn once he has been exposed? I believe justice will 
prevail and that Iraqi rights will triumph. No one has been as 
patient as the Iraqi people. No one has withstood such a savage 
onslaught as our people. I believe our people will remain 
steadfast until they hold final victory in their hand and regain 
their rights, God willing. 
  [Badawi] Are there any other implicit conditions set by the 
United States before lifting the blockade on Iraq, even 
partially? Are there conditions related to Iraq's internal 
situation? 
  [Salih] The resolution itself does not include any 
conditions, except those I have just mentioned, i.e., the 
application of the clauses related to Iraq. But outside the 
resolution, there are proposals. Yes, there are proposals, 
including, for example, the issue of human rights and respect 
for human rights. The issue is completely reversed. It is not 
the Government of Iraq that violates human rights. It is the 
U.S. Government and some officials in the United States and 
Britain that violate human rights in Iraq. They are interfering 
in Iraq's domestic affairs in violation of the UN Charter. They 
imposed two no-fly zones on the official forces, apart from the 
Security Council's resolutions. There is no Security Council 
resolution in this regard. These pretexts have become weak. 
These justifications are unfounded. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, it has been noticed that 
differences surfaced during the recent Security Council debate 
on Iraq, especially among France, Russia, and the PRC on one 
hand and the United State and Britain on the other, and on the 
position to be adopted regarding the assessment of Iraq's 
efforts to handle and respond to the international resolutions. 
The Security Council's members differed. They were unable to 
agree on a statement praising Iraq, for example, for making 
progress regarding disarmament. How do you assess and interpret 
these differences, as well as the French, Russian, and PRC 
positions? 
  [Salih] The facts at present have imposed those differences 
because it is wrong to renew the blockade automatically and 
without any discussion or without considering Iraq's measures to 
implement the relevant Security Council resolutions. Here, any 
objective and fair person will certainly raise his voice and 
call for a pause to discuss the reason why they decide 
automatically, without discussion. Raising such a question will 
lead to differences between the two sides, because some want to 
renew the sanctions without giving convincing reasons and others 
call for discussing and seeing if the reasons that made them 
impose the blockade on Iraq are still there. The answer will 
be: No, none of the reasons are there. Therefore, there will 
be a demand for lifting the blockade. So, the United States and 
Britain are trying to prevent such a trend. 
  [Badawi] There have been Iraqi threats to take some certain 
measure if a settlement was not reached regarding the oil 
embargo on Baghdad, but Tariq 'Aziz did not disclose the nature 
of that measure. What do you mean by a certain measure, 
especially since your demand for lifting the oil embargo was not 
met? 
  [Salih] Let us ask any world state, whose people are placed 
under a comprehensive and firm blockade for four years, what it 
would do when it sees its people dying slowly in a genocide-like 
situation, when its officials and doctors see children dying 
before their eyes without being able to do anything because they 
do not have medicine, and when it sees its people hungry and 
their health affected. What would that state do in such a case? 
It will take measures to protect the people. We should not go 
too far to hint that we will launch a new war. No, we will do 
our utmost to lift that blockade. Our forefathers said: 
Poverty amounts to infidelity. When people starve and are 
naked, they have the right to do everything. 
  If we have managed to restrain our people and prevent them 
from doing things that violate the international will, or can be 
considered a departure from the prevailing concepts, then I 
believe that if our people do something in the future, we will 
not be able to tell to them stop, as we did and continue to do. 
  [Badawi] In other words, is it possible to expect a popular 
Iraqi move? 
  [Salih] I cannot define a certain formula. This might happen 
on the spur of the moment. I cannot now define the formula by 
which we will respond to the injustice our people have suffered. 
However, the wronged have the right to do anything. 
  [Badawi] There is also the question of recognizing Kuwait, 
which was raised again during the debates. Tariq 'Aziz promised 
that if the embargo against Iraq is lifted, then Baghdad might 
reconsider its stand on Kuwait. 
  [Salih] In case the embargo is lifted, then everything can 
be 
discussed. Tariq 'Aziz's answer was clear. I have nothing to 
add to that answer. 
  [Badawi] How can the question of reconsidering the issue of 
Kuwait be interpreted? A final recognition of borders, for 
example? 
  [Salih] Until 2 August 1990, we considered Kuwait a state. 
We dealt with Amir Jabir as a head of state. During his 
meetings with Amir Jabir, President Saddam Husayn dealt with him 
as such. Therefore, when we accepted Resolution 660, I think 
that implicitly meant recognition. But, if we are asked, after 
all that happened to our people, to be lenient to our people's 
enemies -- who insist on harming us -- of course, this puts us 
in an embarrassing position. What will we tell our citizens if 
we keep silent when we see them or their family members die or 
get sick without finding medicine? What will we tell him? What 
will we do? 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, you are taking part in the 
Interparliamentary Union [IPU] meeting in Paris. In accordance 
with an IPU spokesman, a proposal to discuss a request to lift 
the economic sanctions against Iraq has been rejected. In your 
view, does this stand reflect the support of most international 
parliamentarians for the continued sanctions against Baghdad? 
  [Salih] After the disappearance of the role of the former 
Soviet Union, the world now is controlled by a sole superpower, 
the United States. Therefore, all that is prevailing in 
international politics does not reflect the true state of 
affairs. Some fear for their interests, and some even fear 
their own safety. Therefore, the real stands are unclear now. 
Yet, there is broad international sympathy for the Iraqi 
people. This is because the issue is a human issue. Besides, 
the proposal was an extra item. It was not a basic item. 
Therefore, it could be that... 
  [Badawi, interrupting] Yes, but it was rejected. Does this 
reflect a certain orientation, or are your contacts... 
  [Salih, interrupting] No, I do not think it reflects 
reality. 
For the first time, the proposal was put to the vote on the 
first day, while such a thing would usually happen three or four 
days after the opening of the conference. Of course, this seems 
to be a game by the presidency of the conference. 
  [Badawi] The presidency of the conference? 
  [Salih] The traditional presidency of the conference. I do 
not mean the French. The president, I believe, is British. 
  [Badawi] Contacts were recently noted between Baghdad and 
France, Russia, and even Turkey. Turkish President Demirel 
recently called for either toppling the Baghdad regime or 
permitting Ankara to play a role or embark on meditation between 
the Iraqi Government and the Kurds. What is your comment on 
this talk? 
  [Salih] We and Turkey are linked by old and broad relations. 
However, the Iraqi-Turkish relationship was affected by the Gulf 
war. As was the case with several other states, Turkey 
sustained much damage as a result of the blockade. We 
understand what Demirel meant. Demirel meant to say: Enough. 
You are wagering on the possibility that the Iraqi regime will 
fall due to the continued blockade, but this lengthy blockade 
has resulted in nothing to this effect, so you should lift the 
blockade. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih: The Turkish position was 
accompanied by information about Iraqi troop concentrations in 
northern Iraq and a plan to reopen the northern road leading to 
Turkey. Is this true? 
  [Salih] I have no such information. 
  [Badawi] Is there not an intention to reopen the Baghdad- 
Ankara road in order to facilitate exchanges, export, or 
import... 
  [Salih, interrupting] The Baghdad-Ankara road would have 
been open if hadn't been for the Hammer Force and for the U.S. 
and British interference that prevented free movement. This 
road is passable. There are no obstacles on it. 
  [Badawi] But, at present, this road lies in the Kurdish 
region ... 
  [Salih, interrupting] I believe, however, that if there was 
approval of movement, such movement would take place. 
  [Badawi] So, an international green light is awaited. 
  [Salih] Yes, we are awaiting the departure of the Hammer 
Force. It is illegitimate. This force represents flagrant 
interference in the affairs of an independent state and a UN 
member state. 
  [Badawi] Within this context, Mas'ud Barzani has accused the 
Iraqi authorities of taking revenge on the Kurds for the 
extension of the economic embargo on Baghdad by halting fuel 
supplies to the Kurds. 
  [Salih] Iraq is besieged. We told you we suffer much due to 
this blockade, in many forms, including food, medicine, and 
fuel. There is strict rationing of all these materials. The 
Kurds receive their rations. But, if the Kurds compare their 
rations to the pre- war period, the rations will naturally seem 
very small. However, this is the ration Iraq can provide at 
this time. When the blockade of Iraq is lifted, you will find 
that the blockade on the Kurds will consequently and 
simultaneously be lifted. 
  [Badawi] Hence, this measure is linked to ... 
  [Salih, interrupting] It is linked to the main blockade [on 
Iraq]. 
  [Badawi] So, Barzani is right. 
  [Salih] No, he is not right, because he accuses the Iraqi 
Government. But where can the Iraqi Government get additional 
rations? It cannot give to a Kurd twice the ration of an Arab. 
It gives the Kurd the ration mentioned in the ration card. We 
are not responsible for the Kurds' failure to control the 
disbursement and delivery process because we do not have any 
employees there. As a result of the interference in our 
internal affairs, we do not have any authority in that region. 
We deliver the supplies to certain points, and they receive 
them. If they do not deliver the supplies, it is their own 
responsibility. If they sell fuel to Iran for hard currency and 
dispose of fuel as individuals, it is their own responsibility. 
  [Badawi] It is reported that Iraqi oil is being exported to 
Pakistan and Afghanistan via Iran. How true is this? 
  [Salih, laughing] How can oil be exported across borders? 
You know oil is exported in pipelines and requires large 
investments before this can take place. This is not available 
at present. 
  [Badawi] Then, these reports are incorrect. 
  [Salih] Yes, incorrect. 
  [Badawi] Regarding the domestic situation, the opposition is 
talking about the expansion and exacerbation of tension, 
particularly on the security level, in Baghdad and elsewhere in 
Iraq. 
  [Salih] My answer to such utterances is that we welcome 
anyone, even the one who calls himself the opposition, who wants 
to find out or be sure of the true situation. The country is 
opening its doors to all -- to newsmen, politicians, and 
parliamentarians -- to see for themselves in full freedom and to 
become closely acquainted with the situation. I can say in 
advance that they will discover that what they said was wrong 
and does not represent the truth. Security is prevailing all 
over Iraq, except for the area outside state authority, which is 
called the Kurdish area. This area consists of the three 
Governorates of Dahuk, Irbil, and al-Sulaymaniyah. 
  [Badawi] What about the situation in the south? 
  [Salih] The situation in the south is no different from the 
situation in Baghdad. Both are the same. Stability is complete 
and overwhelming. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih: In the aftermath of the 
second Gulf war, promises were made that there would be reforms 
on the political level, toward democracy, pluralism, and so 
forth. Negotiations and dialogues were held with the Kurds. 
Afterward, we heard nothing in this regard. How long will the 
suspension of dialogue between authority and other political 
factions, including the opposition and others, continue? 
  [Salih] We embarked on what you termed political reform at 
the end of the war with Iran. We were expecting to implement 
all that was required by the end of 1990. This included the 
endorsement of a new constitution for the country through a 
referendum and the election of a National Assembly, a Shura 
Council, and the president of the state. These steps were 
expected to be taken at that stage. However, things happened. 
Now, the situation of Iraq is as follows: It is besieged. Part 
of its territory is in one way or another under the control of 
international forces, particularly the United States and 
Britain. Accordingly, these steps are now suspended, but not 
forever. We will implement them as soon as the present 
extraordinary circumstances come to a conclusion. Still, the 
National Assembly discussed and ratified a new party law, which 
is currently valid. Any Iraqis wishing to engage in politics, 
in Iraq or abroad, can apply according to this law. Thus, this 
is a pledge that was not imposed on us but stems from our creed, 
from our conviction that democracy is the right path to run the 
affairs of our country. 
  [Badawi] What about the federation proposal called for by 
the 
opposition factions as a final solution for the Iraqi issue? 
  [Salih] I think there was an answer that was also proposed 
during the dialogue: There is nothing beyond autonomy. We will 
not accept a formula beyond autonomy. We believe this autonomy 
fulfills the aspirations and demands of the Kurdish sons of our 
people. These people enjoyed these rights before their brothers 
in other countries -- Turkey, Syria, and Iran -- did. These 
countries did not give the Kurds what Iraq gave them. But it is 
the game of politics. Iraq wants to build a progressive, 
developed, and cultural system with a sound scientific method. 
Some international powers, however, do not want this. 
Therefore, problems are created. This is one of the problems 
that were first created by Britain and now pursued by the United 
States, to keep Iraq weak and backward. 
  [Badawi] A last word about the future. How do you view it 
from besieged Baghdad? 
  [Salih] The future is for Iraq. The present circumstances 
are extraordinary and temporary. The day will come when the 
world will discover it has wronged Iraq. Many will come to help 
Iraq continue its march because it pursues a sound course. The 
whole question is that we do not want anyone to interfere in our 
internal affairs. Therefore, we respect those who respect us and 
cooperate with them to the end. Iraqi-French relations and the 
previous Iraqi-Soviet relations, and Iraqi-Chinese relations, 
serve as good examples of this. We established good relations, 
even with the United States, but we are very sensitive to any 
interference in our internal affairs. I am sure that future is 
for Iraq. 
  [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the 
Iraqi National Assembly. 
  [Salih] Thank you.
