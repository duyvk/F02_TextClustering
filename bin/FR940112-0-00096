A. 42 CFR part 435 is amended as set forth below: 
PART 435_ELIGIBILITY IN THE STATES, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS, AND AMERICAN SAMOA 
1. The authority citation for part 435 continues to 
read as follows:
Authority:
 Sec. 1102 of the Social Security Act, (42 
U.S.C. 1302), unless otherwise noted.
2. Section 435.831 is revised to read as follows: 
Sect.435.831 
Income eligibility. 
The agency must determine income eligibility of medically needy individuals in accordance with this section.
(a) 
Budget periods. 
(1) The agency must use budget periods of not more than 6 months to compute income. The agency may use more than one budget
period. 
(2) The agency may include in the budget period in which income is computed all or part of the 3-month retroactive period
specified in Sect.435.914. The budget period can begin no earlier than the first month in the retroactive period
in which the individual received covered services. This provision applies to all medically needy individuals except
in groups for whom criteria more restrictive than that used in the SSI program apply. 
(3) If the agency elects to begin the first budget period for the medically needy in any month of the 3-month period prior
to the date of the application in which the applicant received covered services, this election applies to all medically
needy groups. 
(b) 
Determining countable income. 
The agency must deduct the following amounts from income to determine the individual's countable income. 
(1) For individuals under age 21 and caretaker relatives, the agency must deduct amounts that would be deducted in
determining eligibility under the State's AFDC plan. 
(2) For aged, blind, or disabled individuals in States covering all SSI recipients, the agency must deduct amounts
that would be deducted in determining eligibility under SSI. However, the agency must also deduct the highest amounts
from income that would be deducted in determining eligibility for optional State supplements if these supplements
are paid to all individuals who are receiving SSI or would be eligible for SSI except for their income. 
(3) For aged, blind, or disabled individuals in States using income requirements more restrictive than SSI, the agency
must deduct amounts that are no more restrictive than those used under the Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972 and no more
liberal than those used in determining eligibility under SSI or an optional State supplement. However, the amounts
must be at least the same as those that would be deducted in determining eligibility, under Sect.435.121, of the categorically
needy. 
(c) 
Eligibility based on countable income. 
If countable income determined under paragraph (b) of this section is equal to or less than the applicable income standard
under Sect.435.814, the individual or family is eligible for Medicaid. 
(d) 
Deduction of incurred medical expenses. 
If countable income exceeds the income standard, the agency must deduct from income medical expenses incurred by
the individual or family or financially responsible relatives that are not subject to payment by a third party. An
expense is incurred on the date liability for the expense arises. The agency must determine deductible incurred expenses
in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section and deduct those expenses in accordance with paragraph
(h) of this section. 
(e) 
Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required deductions based on kinds of services. 
Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g), in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income,
the agency must include the following:
