FIRMER prices and lower processing costs helped SSAB, the Swedish steel
group, swing to a pre-tax profit of SKr355m (Dollars 43m) in the first nine
months from a SKr123m loss in the same period last year.
The company said it expected a full-year profit of around SKr600m, a
dramatic rebound from losses last year of SKr165m.
SSAB, which was privatised last year, said it had benefited from the price
rise in Europe after European steelmakers cut production in response to a 10
per cent fall in consumption.
The price effect was enhanced for SSAB by the devaluation of the Swedish
krona, which left prices for the group's products 5 per cent higher in krona
terms in the first nine months than in the same period last year.
Higher steel prices were the main factor behind a 6 per cent rise in sales
to SKr9.38bn. At the same time SSAB said it achieved a 4 per cent cut in
processing costs through improved productivity and capacity adjustments and
a 5 per cent cut in employee numbers to 9,500.
SSAB said demand for steel in western Europe would remain weak for the rest
of the year and price trends would depend on levels of output.
But it made its full-year forecast based on the group's improved
efficiencies and the lower krona.
The biggest division, Tunnplat steel plate, fell from a loss of SKr113m in
the first nine months of 1992 to a profit of SKr27m this year, on sales up
10 per cent to SKr4.56bn. Group net cash flow improved from SKr70m to
SKr188m.
One-off charges of SKr60m to cover a blast furnace breakdown and the
reinstatement of 200 workers ordered by the Swedish labour court were in
large part offset by a capital gain of SKr40m from sales of shares in Volvo
and Sydkraft.
