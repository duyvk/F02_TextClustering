ACTION: 
Final rule.
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is today issuing a final rule which amends the implementing
regulations for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). A number of the revisions are required by the American Technology
Preeminence Act of 1992, including provisions on: participation by foreign companies in ATP; the establishment
of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act; and a new requirement that
"joint research and development ventures" be industry-led. Further, requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP
recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under ATP have been repealed by the Act, and are thus
removed from the regulations. Similarly, ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations
has been repealed. Also, changes not required by the Act are made, including changes to simplify and clarify the selection
criteria, and to streamline the internal operations of ATP, including the selection process.

EFFECTIVE DATE: 
This rule is effective on January 6, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology is today issuing a final rule which amends regulations found at
part 295 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which implement the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). The
Advanced Technology Program assists United States businesses to carry out high-risk research and development that
will, if successful, improve the competitive position of the United States and its businesses by accelerating the
development of technologies that have significant potential to stimulate economic growth, and raise productivity.
ATP enters into cooperative agreements with United States joint research and development ventures and United States
businesses, especially small businesses. Where appropriate, Federal laboratories may be involved in ATP projects
consistent with other authority, such as cooperative research and development agreements under section 12 of the
Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980.
Description of the Changes
Changes to part 295 include revisions on the following topics (please see the analysis of comments below for additional
details):
&bull;The eligibility of foreign firms to participate in ATP is addressed in a new section 295.3 of the regulations,
and a related definition of "United States owned company" is added in section 295.2(r). These revisions follow
the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(9)).
&bull;The establishment of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act
(Pub. L. 96-517, as amended) is set out at section 295.8(a). These revisions follow the requirements of section
201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)). That statute requires that
title to inventions made in whole or part with Program funds reside with for-profit companies that have been incorporated
in the United States. Entities that are not for-profit organizations incorporated in this country are not eligible
to obtain title to inventions made under the Program.
&bull;A new requirement that "joint research and development ventures" be industry-led, set out at Sect.Sect.295.2(i)
and 295.21, and the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations, set
out at Sect.295.30. These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively,
of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)).
&bull;Requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under
ATP have been repealed, and are thus removed from existing Sect.295.7(c) of the regulations. This revision follows
the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991.
&bull;Finally, changes not required by the Act are made to the selection criteria, and to the internal operations
of ATP, including the selection process. These changes particularly include revisions to the remaining definitions
in Sect.295.2, changes to the selection process described in Sect.Sect.295.4 and 295.5, changes to the selection
criteria as set out in Sect.295.6, and changes to program administration found in Sect.Sect.295.7 and 295.14.
