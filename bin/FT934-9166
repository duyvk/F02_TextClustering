third quarter slide

INFLATION figures in the US cut less ice than they did on Tuesday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT lost Tuesday afternoon's gains, the DAX index closing 1.10 higher
on the session at 2,023.84, and the Ibis-indicated DAX falling from 2,040.74
to 2,020.11 at the post-bourse close. Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.4bn.
Company results news was uninspiring or worse. Mr John Blackley of James
Capel chose the first adjective to describe flat profits and dividend from
Siemens, which ended the post-bourse with its shares in similar condition at
DM715.
Capel reckoned that heavy provisioning hit Hoechst, with the chemical
company's pre-tax profits down by 40 per cent after nine months and worse in
the September quarter. The shares fell DM5.50 to DM268.70, 60pfg higher than
BASF - to which they stood at a DM41, or 20 per cent premium at the
beginning of this year.
Meanwhile, Asko's sensitivity to upcoming news was reflected in a new 1993
high on the sale of its stake in Adia, the Swiss employment agency group.
The shares rose DM33 to DM991; the sale was predicted in March of this year,
but the actuality meant that, for the German retailer, a potential liability
was at an end.
PARIS lost virtually all of Tuesday's gains. It was influenced by a number
of factors, including a 13 per cent fall in Euro Disney. The CAC-40 index
ended down 25.56 or 1.2 per cent at 2,087.33. Turnover was FFr3.6bn. The
market will be closed today.
Euro Disney was twice suspended, once before the announcement of its
FFr5.3bn loss for the year ended September, and then when, on resumption, it
went limit down at FFr37.40. The shares eventually closed off FFr5.70 at
FFr38.00.
Mr Michael Woodcock, French analyst at Nikko Europe, commented that the
problem with the theme park had more to do with poor turnover of paying
customers than expenses. 'The group has done all it can to reduce expenses,
but it has failed so far to attract sufficient quality visitors who will
spend,' he said. 'The park has also proved to be far more seasonal that
Disney ever thought, and compared with other theme parks it still remains
expensive.'
The operation was faced with huge gearing and a need for massive
restructuring, added Mr Woodcock, and it was going to be a long time before
the shares attracted investment support.
AMSTERDAM weakened, largely on technically inspired trading related to
selling of futures and options. The CBS Tendency index eased 1.8 or 1.3 per
cent to 134.2.
Further negative reports regarding Alcazar, which involves negotiations
between four European airlines on forming an alliance, left KLM down Fl 1.20
to Fl 38.10.
Royal Dutch closed off Fl 2.40 to Fl 201.60 ahead of results which are
expected to be released today; Unilever went against the trend with a gain
of 60 cents to Fl 216.60.
MILAN derived little benefit from Senate approval of key parts of the budget
late on Tuesday. Shares were dragged lower again by further sharp falls in
telecoms stocks.
The Comit index gave up 12.93 or 2.4 per cent to 533.45.
Sip shed L100 or 3.2 per cent to L3,004 in volume of 27.7m shares while Stet
fell L192 or 5.2 per cent to L3,507 in volume of 21.9m shares.
Analysts noted that the very high volume of trading in the shares indicated
profit-taking by US investors, already unnerved by the country's fragile
political situation. The sell-off was sparked on Tuesday by the exclusion of
Italian companies from a possible link between AT & T and the German and
French state telephone companies, a development which, yesterday, many
analysts doubted would have any negative impact in the medium term on Stet
and Sip.
Fiat, cutting December car output, shed L77 to L3,345 in volume of 9.4m
shares following comments by Mr Giovanni Agnelli that recovery in European
car demand could be delayed until the end of 1994.
ZURICH continued higher although shares ended off their best levels with the
market unable to maintain the momentum seen on Tuesday. The SMI index, 30
points ahead during the morning, finished 15.0 higher at 2,742.1.
Bearer shares in Adia, the temporary employment group, shed SFr1 to SFr173
as the company announced that Mr Klaus Jacobs was buying the Adia stake held
by Asko, the German retailer. However, the participation certificates surged
SFr40 to SFr168 in response to news that they will be converted into bearers
as part of a share simplification plan.
Sulzer, the engineering group, eased SFr5 to SFr770 after a day's low of
SFr764 in response to its forecast of steady profits but a fall in new
orders. SMH dipped SFr6 to SFr224 as the watchmaker said it had chosen an as
yet unnamed car producer as a partner to build its environmentally friendly
Swatchmobile city car.
MADRID's general index closed 1.12 higher at 300.66 in turnover of some
Pta23bn. Trading was edgy, but Cepsa, the oils group, rose Pta25 to Pta2,410
on a 56 per cent rise in nine-month profits and Fecsa, the Catalan utility,
put on Pta7 to Pta793 on Iberdrola's sale of a 4 per cent stake to Endesa.
