SCIENTISTS IN Kenya have identified behaviour-modifying chemicals in desert
locusts that could be used to prevent them from swarming and devastating
crops in Africa and Asia.
Professor Thomas Odhiambo, director of the International Centre of Insect
Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi, told a meeting at the House of Commons in
London yesterday that research into preventing locust plagues was 'moving in
the right direction'.
His team has isolated chemicals which make many locusts reach sexual
maturity and lay their eggs within a very short time of each other. This
brings large numbers together and leads to swarming and migration to
crop-growing regions.
Prof Odhiambo said the research, which is costing Dollars 1.2m a year, could
end the need for mass spraying of locust breeding grounds in semi-arid
savannah where the insects serve an important role in recycling nutrients
such as nitrogen.
'When you spray as you have been doing for years at the beginning of each
outbreak, it's in very fragile environments. You're not asking permission
from the pastoral communities and the insecticides end up in the camel milk
which these people drink,' he said.
If the research was successful, it could also overcome problems that arise
from the misplaced generosity of international donors, he said.
Donated pesticide left over from previous locust plagues was now lying
leaking in dumps in Morocco and Somalia. 'These countries don't know how to
deal with expired insecticides,' he said. 'There's no incinerator anywhere
in Africa.'
Prof Odhiambo said it was too early to specify how the chemicals would be
used to prevent swarming and keep the locusts in their isolated, grasshopper
state.
'In normal breeding grounds there are probably less than half a dozen
locusts per hectare,' he said. 'From next year our concentration has to be
in the field to understand how these chemicals are responsible for managing
this behaviour. We think we've identified a small population in Namibia
which has never swarmed and we need to understand why.'
They also wanted to discover what made swarms of locusts break up and return
to their isolated state.
The research is being funded by the United Nations Development Programme,
the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the German and
Swedish governments. The initial four-year programme ends in December next
year and Prof Odhiambo thinks at least 10 years of fieldwork will be needed.
