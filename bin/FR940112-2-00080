II. Discussion 
 
Dotson essentially raises four arguments. First, he believes that illegal activities undertaken solely to satisfy
a drug addiction cannot constitute SGA. Second, assuming that illegal activity can constitute SGA, Dotson claims
that the ALJ's finding of SGA in his case is unsupported by substantial evidence. Third, Dotson contends that if illegal
activity undertaken to support a drug habit can constitute SGA, then the Secretary is required to deduct the cost of
the narcotics from the claimant's income as an impairment-related work expense. Fourth and finally, Dotson believes
that using illegal activities to furnish the basis for finding SGA denies him due process and equal protection of the
laws under the United States Constitution. 
 
A. Overview 
 
The Social Security Act ("Act"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 301 
et seq.,
 provides for the payment of benefits to disabled persons. Title II of the Act governs the payment of Old-Age, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance ("OASDI") benefits to disabled persons who have contributed to the Social Security program.
42 U.S.C. 401 
et seq.
 Title XVI of the Act, the title under which Dotson filed his application for benefits, provides for the payment of Supplemental
Security Income ("SSI") benefits to disabled persons who are indigent. 42 U.S.C. 1382 
et seq.
; see generally 
Bowen
 v. 
Yuckert,
 482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987). Both Titles II and XVI define disability as an "inability to engage in any substantial gainful
activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in
death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months *
 9*
 9*." 42 U.S.C. 423(d)(1)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(A). 
 Pursuant to statutory authority, the Secretary has promulgated regulations establishing a five-step sequential
analysis for determining whether an SSI claimant is disabled. See 20 CFR 416.920; 
Sullivan
 v. 
Zebley,
 493 U.S. 521, 525 (1990).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The first step of the process, and the only one relevant for purposes of this appeal, requires the Secretary to determine
whether the claimant is engaging in SGA. See 20 CFR 416.920(a). A finding of SGA means that the claimant is ineligible
for SSI benefits. 
Id.
 at Sect.416.920(b); 
Yuckert,
 482 U.S. at 140. In this case, because the ALJ found that Dotson's stealing and panhandling constituted SGA, he denied
Dotson's claim for benefits without moving to the next step in the sequential analysis.

The parties have devoted some attention to the issue of whether panhandling, or the income therefrom, can cause a person
to become ineligible for SSI benefits. We decline to reach this issue. As noted above, the ALJ determined that, due
to the poor area in which Dotson panhandles, the bulk of his income comes from illegal activities. We believe the ALJ's
finding to be supported by substantial evidence and, therefore, leave the panhandling issue to a court with the question
properly before it. 
 </FOOTNOTE>
B. Illegal Activity as SGA 
 
Our research reveals that we are the first appellate court to address the issue of whether illegal activity can support
a finding of SGA. The handful of federal trial courts faced with this question, including the district court below,
have answered unanimously in the affirmative.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Because the ALJ and district court's determination that illegal activity can constitute SGA is a construction of
the Secretary's regulations, we review this decision of law 
de novo.

 </FOOTNOTE>
As the definition of disability quoted above indicates, the inability to engage in SGA is a statutory prerequisite
to obtaining either SSI or OASDI benefits. Nonetheless, Congress delegated to the Secretary the responsibility
for defining SGA. 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3)(D) (Title XVI). In response to the Act's mandate, and as the components of
the term suggest, the Secretary has defined SGA as "work activity that is both substantial and gainful." See 20 CFR
416.972. Work activity is substantial if it "involves doing significant physical or mental activities." 
Id.
 at Sect.416.972(a). Work activity is gainful if it is "the kind of work usually done for pay or profit, whether or
not a profit is realized." 
Id.
 at Sect.416.972(b); see generally 
Callaghan
 v. 
Shalala,
 992 F.2d 692 (7th Cir. 1993) (discussing elements of SGA).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Activities such as taking care of one's self, performing household tasks, engaging in hobbies or therapy, and attending
school, clubs, or social programs generally do not constitute SGA. 20 CFR 416.972(c). 
<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
For a reconstituted formulation of the above definition, see 20 CFR 416.910, which provides: "Substantial gainful
activity means work that_(a) Involves doing significant and productive physical or mental duties; and (b) Is done
(or intended) for pay or profit."
