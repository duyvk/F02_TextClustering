  [Text] Pietermaritzburg March 26 SAPA -- Natal Midlands 
branch of the African National Congress [ANC] on Saturday warned 
that if drastic measures were not taken in Natal the province 
would be on brink of full-scale war. In a memorandum to the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] -- delivered by up to 
10,000 ANC supporters who marched to Loop Street police station 
-- the ANC also said it rejected any postponement of the April 
elections. 
  "We, the people of Natal, want to make it clear that any 
postponement of the elections (nationally or in Natal) would 
plunge this country into a disaster and turn it into a 
wasteland." 
  The ANC's memorandum went on to condemn the government for 
"continued sponsorship of the war in Natal by the South African 
Police through its very top generals". The memorandum was 
referring to recent disclosures made before the Goldstone 
Commission on political violence. ? The ANC's memorandum 
included a number of demands aimed at creating a climate for 
free politicking in kwaZulu/Natal. The organisation called for, 
among other things, the takeover of the kwaZulu Police by the 
SAP [Sout African Police], and an end to kwaZulu government 
paramilitary training camps. 
  Addressing supporters before the march, ANC Midlands leader 
Harry Gwala warned Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi that his days were numbered. "Gatsha should 
try to read events because he's only got 31 days to breathe and 
kwaZulu will be finished." 
  Mr Gwala also lashed out at the Democratic Party [DP] in 
Natal, which on friday called for a postponement of the 
elections because of the volatile climate in the province. He 
said the DP had "become spoilers like the IFP". 
  Mr Gwala warned of escalating violence if the elections were 
postponed, saying "there will be more violence because no-one 
can stop us from going forward to elections". "We want to decide 
who will govern this country," he said. 
  The ANC Midlands leader said his organisation wanted peace, 
but he urged his opponents in the IFP not to "play with fire" by 
denying political campaigning in Natal. 
  He also called on King Goodwill Zwelithini not to act as 
"the 
king of Inkatha" but as a Zulu monarch. 
  Addressing minority groups in the audience, Mr Gwala said 
voting for State President F W de Klerk's National Party was 
like "backing a dead horse". 
  Saturday's activities passed without incident, police said. 
ANC Regional Secretary Mr Sifiso Nkabinda said no reports of 
violence had been received by 3.30PM. However, three ANC 
supporters were seriously injured when the bus they were 
travelling on to pietermaritzburg overturned. 
  Traffic officials at the scene, on Duncan McKenzie Drive 
just 
outside Pietermaritzburg, said another 50 passengers were hurt, 
but none were seriously injured. The bus slipped on to its side 
coming around a bend. Police said enthusiastic passengers were 
jumping around in the vehicle, which may be caused it to 
overturn.
