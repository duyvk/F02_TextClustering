  [Text] The political and military situation in northern 
Angola is characterized by war. This was revealed by Army 
General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of the general staff of the 
northern front, in an interview with the Voice of the Resistance 
of the Black Cockerel and TERRA ANGOLANA newspaper. According 
to Genertal Numa, Luanda is carrying out a full military 
offensive, totally disrespecting the Lusaka peace talks. It 
wants to capture positions under the control of the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the 
provinces of Zaire, Uige, Bengo, and Cuanza Norte. 
  General Numa said the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] relies on the assistance of 
mercenaries from different nationalities, including Portuguese 
marines stationed in Cabinda Province. He said MPLA-PT warships 
cruise along the Cabinda-Luanda corridor weekly, carrying lethal 
materiel. 
  However, Commander Kamalata Numa reaffirmed UNITA's desire 
to 
continue to find peace through dialogue, but stressed that the 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola will henceforth not 
tolerate any kind of provocation. He said UNITA was carrying 
out all kinds of defensive measures to defend the strategic city 
of Soyo. In conclusion, General Numa stressed that UNITA will 
not be held responsible for damage to oil installations in the 
event of an attack on Soyo.
