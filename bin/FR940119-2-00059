<DOCTITLE>Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health</DOCTITLE>
Part H, Public Health Service (PHS), chapter HA (Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health), of the Statement of
Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (42
FR 61318, December 2, 1977, as amended most recently at 58 FR 7140-41, February 4, 1993) is amended to reflect
changes in the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), as required
by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, Public Law 103-43. Section 161 of the law amended
section 493 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. section 289B, in several respects. Specifically, section
493, as amended, requires that the ORI be an independent entity in DHHS and that the Director, ORI, report to the Secretary.
This revision accomplishes the statutory mandate while leaving ORI organizationally within the OASH for budget
and general administrative purposes.
This notice does not affect the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to conduct investigations of alleged
misconduct solely involving regulated research.
