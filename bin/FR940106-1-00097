The index shall be computed at least monthly, weighted by the proportion migrating during each month (or shorter time
period) and summed to estimate survival for the water year. Total survival for the entire fall-run migration period
shall either use monitoring information collected during each water year's outmigration to determine the specific
pattern of migration for the water year, or shall assume monthly migration to be 17% in April, 65% in May, and 18% in June.
For purposes of this computation, mortality for the Sacramento River Reach between Sacramento and Walnut Grove (which
is reflected in the computation above by the term "(^2.45925+.0420748T)") shall be reset to zero before the index
is calculated if this term is negative, as happens at low temperatures. 
(iii)
 Computing salmon smolt survival index values for San Joaquin River. 
Index values on the San Joaquin River shall be computed according to the following formula: 
SJSI = (0.341271^0.000025E+0.000067F)/1.8 
where 
SJSI = San Joaquin River Salmon Index value 
E = Average Central Valley Project plus State Water Project exports measured in cfs 
F = Mean daily flow in cfs in San Joaquin River at 
Stockton, calculated as Old River flow subtracted 
from San Joaquin River flow at Mossdale. Old River 
flow is calculated from ratio of Brandt Bridge flow 
to exports. 
The index shall be computed at least monthly, weighted by the proportion migrating during each month (or shorter time
period) and summed to estimate survival for the water year. Total survival for the entire fall-run migration period
shall either use monitoring information collected during each water year's outmigration to determine the specific
pattern of migration for the water year, or shall assume monthly migration to be 45% in April and 55% in May. 
(b)
 Revised Criteria.
 The following criteria are applicable to state waters specified in Table 1-1, at Section (C)(3) ("Striped
Bass_Salinity : 3. Prisoners Point_Spawning") of the Water Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco
Bay_Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta Estuary, adopted by the California State Water Resources Control Board in State
Board Resolution No. 91-34 on May 1, 1991:
