Efforts at understanding the "Final Solution" the Nazi term for the 
annihilation of the Jews -- have given rise to two polar positions, the 
intentionalist and the functionalist. Briefly, the intentionalists see a direct 
line between Hitler's anti-Semitic proclamations and the introduction of 
anti-Jewish measures, including the Final Solution. In contrast, the 
functionalists maintain that in part the Final Solution emerged out of a series 
of improvisations and as a reaction to existing conditions. Partly because no 
written directive by Hitler was ever found ordering the systematic annihilation 
of Jews, the functionalists see no direct connection between the anti-Semitic 
proclamations by leaders of the Third Reich and the Final Solution. 
Specifically, too, they assume that the Final Solution emerged as a reaction to 
German military disappointments on the Russian front. Unlike the 
intentionalists, the functionalists think that, as an official policy, the 
Final Solution was established not before but during the Russian campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly innocent, the intentionalist and functionalist arguments may have 
significant political overtones. The functionalists, by perceiving the Final 
Solution, in part, as a haphazard reaction to existing conditions, diminish its 
importance and dilute the responsibility for its establishment and 
implementation. Such a position may play into the hands of some revisionists 
who deny not only the significance, but also the very existence of the Final 
Solution. 
</P>
<P>
It is indeed a matter of historical record that before the Nazi government 
began to concentrate on the persecution of Jews it was busy murdering and 
placing into the concentration camps thousand of Germans whom it perceived as 
actual or potential political opponents. Later on, the same government applied 
equally oppressive measures toward native populations in newly conquered 
territories. Such measures were introduced with special ruthlessness to Poland 
where the first targets of destruction were Polish elites rather than Jews. 
Thousands of Poles were murdered while additional thousands were incarcerated 
in concentration camps. In fact, at first, most of the Auschwitz inmates 
belonged to the Polish elites. In the end, the Nazis succeeded in decimating 
the Polish intelligentsia. 
</P>
<P>
Such criminal governmental activities created a proper climate for the 
annihilation of Jews without, however, establishing causal connections between 
them. Direct causal links are suggested by other developments. One of them is 
the emergence of the Einsatzgruppen, SS units whose aim it was to kill 
civilians in the soon-to-be-conquered Russian territories. The training of 
these groups began in March and April, 1941. After the invasion of Russia on 
June 22, 1941, the Einsatzgruppen and their collaborators succeeded in 
murdering an estimated 1.5 million civilians, about 90% of whom were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Other measures in support of the Final Solution were also being introduced. On 
July 31, 1941, Goering authorized Heydrich to prepare a plan for the "total" 
solution of the Jewish question. On Oct. 23, 1941, Himmler issued an order 
forbidding Jewish emigration from German-held territories. Approximately at 
that time work began on the first Jewish death camps at Belzec and Chelmno. On 
Nov. 29, 1941, invitations went out for the Wannsee conference, one of whose 
aims was to coordinate Jewish deportations from across Europe. Originated in 
the highest echelons of the Nazi regime, these moves suggest a 
well-orchestrated plan of action that set in motion the Final Solution.

Arno J. Mayer's "Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?" while presenting a thorough 
historical account of the Final Solution touches upon some of the issues 
contained in the intentionalist-functionalist debate. Offering a lucid 
description of the complex historical events that led into World War I and 
World War II, and relying on extensive knowledge of European history, the 
history of the Third Reich and the history of the Final Solution, the book 
deals with the intricate dynamics of these complex events rather than their 
structures. Describing the processes of important ideological and behavioral 
currents and counter currents, the author offers a fascinating account of one 
of the most important chapters in human history. 
</P>
<P>
But how does this book fit into the intentionalist-functionalist debate? 
</P>
<P>
Mayer writes that: "Anti-Semitism was a cardinal postulate of the 
Weltanschauung which fired the rise of the Nazi movement as well as the 
consolidation of the Nazi regime and its drive for the mastery of Europe. But 
although anti-Semitism was an essential tenet of the Nazi worldview, it was 
neither its foundation nor its principal or sole intention. Anti-Semitism was 
one of several central creeds of an essentially syncretic ideology, the others 
being social Darwinism, the geopolitics of eastern expansionism, and 
anti-Marxism. While these four articles of faith were closely enmeshed and 
eventually crystallized into an indivisible belief system, within this system 
their position and importance in relation to each other varied with time, 
place, and circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
The author is correct in asserting that anti-Semitism was not the only Nazi 
creed, and he elucidates these different components with accuracy. He is also 
right in assuming that the importance of these creeds " . . . varied with time, 
place, and circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
Having said that, Mayer, in a somewhat ambiguous way, shows how anti-Semitism 
became ingrained in other Nazi creeds when he writes that: "Anti-Semitism 
permeated Hitler's worldview and project. It was also consonant with his 
interpretation -- and execration -- of the corruption of the modern world. But 
while Hitler condemned the Jews as the chief disease-carrying poisoners and 
parasites of contemporary society, he struck out through them against the 
processes and forces of emancipation of modernization, which for him were the 
ultimate source of pollution. Indeed, if Hitler's worldview had an epicenter, 
it was his deep-seated animosity toward contemporary civilization, and not his 
hatred for Jews, which was grafted onto it." 
</P>
<P>
In another place, Mayer says that: "The Nazi leaders stressed that there was, 
of course, no fighting Marxism and Bolshevism without understanding them, which 
meant facing up to the pivotal role of the Jews. All of Europe needed to 
realize that, having invented the Bolshevik madness, the Jews were 
masterminding it from Moscow in their bid for world domination." 
</P>
<P>
From these statements, and others, it appears that the Nazi government blamed 
the Jews for "Marxism," "Bolshevism," "Modernism," and a host of other societal 
ills. Since the elimination of these ills assumed a pivotal position in 
Hitler's overall program, it follows that the elimination of Jews who were 
defined as responsible for these ills was also a central aim of the Third 
Reich. 
</P>
<P>
Once opportunities for destroying the Jews presented themselves, Hitler and 
other Nazi leaders took advantage of them. The war with Russia was one of those 
opportunities. Moreover, historical evidence shows that eventually the 
annihilation of Jews took precedence over the conduct of the war. Jews 
continued to be murdered en mass even though they were a potentially valuable 
economic commodity, and when the trains transporting them to their death were 
needed by the military. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the facts, but facts seldom speak for themselves. The 
enormity and complexity of the Final Solution demand more study and more 
deliberation. "Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?" meets both of these 
requirements and becomes a welcome addition to the existing literature.
