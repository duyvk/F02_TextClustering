Option 5: Promulgate Regulatory Standards for the Management of CKD Waste. 
As previously stated, the Agency's analysis of the risks associated with cement kiln dust suggest that by merely lifting
the exemption at 40 CFR 264.1(b)(8), certain pathways of potential concern under the hypothetical scenarios may
not be adequately addressed under Options 3 and 4, should EPA decide that subtitle C regulation is warranted for CKD
in the first instance. Specifically, EPA's risk assessment indicates indirect foodchain risks are of potential
concern from releases of CKD from disposal piles to nearby surface waters and crop lands and from the direct application
of CKD to croplands as a soil amendment assuming reasonable worst-case conditions. The Agency acknowledges, as discussed
in detail in Chapter 6, that these modelled risks, while plausible, are of probably minimal incidence. 
As described above, the likely regulatory result under Options 3 and 4 would be to make CKD generated by a kiln that burns
listed hazardous wastes itself a hazardous waste under the derived-from rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). The indirect
foodchain risks potentially identified in this Report, however, are not associated only with CKD generated by hazardous
waste burning kilns. As a result, EPA is also considering regulatory mechanisms that would specifically address
these risks, including promulgating regulatory standards under subtitle C for the management of CKD waste that would
provide adequate protection against these risks. 
RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(C) provides that EPA shall within six months of the RTC "determine to promulgate regulations
under this subchapter * * * or determine that such regulations are unwarranted." The statute does
not describe the type of regulation that EPA should consider promulgating (if any), other than that such regulation
be under subtitle C of RCRA. For example, RCRA does not expressly direct EPA to determine whether to list CKD as hazardous,
as required for other wastes under the mandates in RCRA section 3001(c). Furthermore, RCRA section 2002(a) gives
the Administrator the broad authority to "prescribe * * * such regulations as are necessary to carry
out his functions under this chapter." The Agency believes it has the authority where appropriate to promulgate
Federally-enforceable regulatory standards under subtitle C for the management of CKD. EPA could explore mechanisms
for imposing regulatory standards for CKD, e.g., under grant of rulemaking authority under section 3001(b)(3)(C).
Alternatively, EPA could consider conditioning the CKD exemption from the definition of hazardous waste (40 CFR
261.4(b)(8)) on compliance with appropriate management standards. 
EPA could promulgate minimally burdensome management standards for cement kiln dust that would adequately control
the indirect foodchain risks, such as: (1) Requiring that dust piles be kept covered to control fugitive emissions
and institute surface water runoff and erosion controls; (2) maintaining groundwater protection, perhaps by requiring
that CKD piles be maintained on a non-earthen base or by requiring a liner; and (3) establishing risk-based concentration
thresholds for all constituents of concern (including 2,3,7,8-TCDD, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) for CKD used
as a direct soil amendment. Additional or alternative standards may be appropriate, and EPA welcomes comments and
suggestions on this aspect of its options. 
Of the five options being considered by the Agency, Options 3, 4 and 5 would provide more control through implementation
of the provisions of subtitle C. The principal difference between Options 3 and 4 is the timing of the implementation
of the regulatory controls. Option 3 provides industry additional time to implement waste minimization/pollution
prevention options and more protective CKD management standards. Option 4 would bring CKD under subtitle C regulatory
control more quickly. Removing the exemption also would impose regulatory equity between CKD generated from kilns
that burn RCRA hazardous waste and residues from other incinerators that burn RCRA hazardous waste that do not have
such an exemption. Option 5 would provide management standards to control all CKD, and would be targeted to specifically
address only those risks of potential concern. 
The Agency did not evaluate the risk from the land application of agricultural lime, so it cannot determine whether
there is an increase in incremental risk when CKD is substituted. In any event, CKD-sewage sludge derived fertilizers
and soil amendments are considered safe for such uses as fertilizer and pose minimal risk because these final products
are required to be tested to assure they comply with all provisions of 40 CFR part 503, which are fully protective of
human health and the environment. It should be noted that if the exemption is removed, fertilizer that is derived from
CKD generated from a kiln that burns listed hazardous waste is itself a hazardous waste under the derived-from rule
(40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)); the extent of regulation, however, is limited (see 40 CFR 266.20(b)). 
In addition, it should also be noted that under current rules, if CKD is recycled, the resulting clinker is not automatically
subject to the provisions of subtitle C. By removing the exemption, however, clinker may be affected by the derived-from
rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)) if the kiln burns listed hazardous waste, thereby becoming a hazardous waste. The Agency
has not yet fully analyzed available data on trace constituents in clinker. Based on our understanding of current
data, however, the Agency does not believe that clinker produced from kilns that burn listed hazardous waste generally
poses a hazard to human health and the environment. The Agency is, therefore, considering crafting appropriate regulatory
language for clinker. The Agency, however, is interested in receiving comment on this issue. 
E. Public Comment 
The Agency encourages all interested parties to obtain a copy of the Report to Congress and provide comments or further
information that might be necessary to the Agency on the data, analysis, and findings contained in the Report to Congress,
and on the types of specific requirements that might be necessary under RCRA subtitle C or D for this waste. In addition
to receiving input from the various stakeholders regarding the appropriateness of each of the five regulatory options
presented for the management of CKD, the Agency is interested in receiving additional information and/or comment
on the following: 
&bull;CKD sampling data (analytical results, including conditions of sampling, fuels burned at time of sampling,
types of samples collected and analytical methods used). 
&bull;Documented cases of damage to human health and the environment traceable to CKD disposal, including notices
of violation, administrative orders, and scientific studies. 
&bull;How the burning of RCRA hazardous wastes, non-hazardous wastes (such as tires and non-hazardous used oils),
and fossil fuels affect the quantity and chemistry of generated CKD, as well as the partitioning of toxic metals, chlorides,
and alkalis between stack gases, CKD, and clinker. 
&bull;The Agency's consideration of drafting appropriate regulatory language for clinker acknowledging that,
based on the Agency's preliminary assessment, clinker produced from kilns that burn hazardous waste generally poses
no hazard to human health or the environment. 
&bull;The extent to which activities such as farming (including the recreational gardening of vegetables) and fishing
occur around these facilities.
