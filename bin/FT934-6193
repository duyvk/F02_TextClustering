The government has decided to press ahead with its long-term plan for
electronic charging of motorway users, but ruled out proposals for an
interim system of permits to finance maintenance improvements on the
motorway network.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is expected to announce before
Christmas that there will be no charges for motorway users this side of the
general election due by 1997. But his cabinet colleagues have given him the
go-ahead to develop a scheme for electronic road tolls - based on
computerised recorders or tags in cars and lorries - which could be
operational by 1998, a year or so after the last date for the election.
The transport department's wrangle with the Treasury over whether money
raised through the road charges should be committed in full to spending on
the network is unresolved. Treasury ministers remain strongly opposed to
this direct hypothecation of revenue from user charges.
With the Pounds 19bn road-building programme one of the main targets of the
government's public spending squeeze, Mr MacGregor floated the idea, in a
consultation paper during the summer, of charging for monthly or yearly
motorway permits.
The roads programme will be one of the main victims of the spending cuts in
next Tuesday's Budget, although Mr MacGregor has won a firm commitment from
the Treasury to fill some of the resulting gap through privately-financed
schemes.
The government's green paper on road pricing suggested a permit system could
bridge the gap before the technology which is under development is
sufficiently advanced to introduce electronic pricing.
Ministers said the government could introduce a scheme similar to
Switzerland's vignette system - under which motorists display a permit
bought from post offices or petrol stations - by 1996. But Mr MacGregor
intends to announce within the next few weeks that the government has
decided the idea is unworkable. He has rejected it for political and
practical reasons.
On one level ministers decided that it would be foolish to introduce any
charges before the next general election. On another they concluded that the
flat-rate charges implied by permits would alienate many traditional
Conservative party supporters in rural or semi-rural areas who use sections
of the motorway for relatively short journeys. The practical difficulties
include the fact that the cost of permits would bear no relation to use or
to the timing of journeys.
Once they had bought a permit motorists could increase their use of
motorways to get the most from the cost. A flat-rate charge would also
provide no incentive for drivers to travel offpeak.
By contrast electronic pricing would provide the flexibility to vary charges
for length and timing and charges would be on a strictly pay-as-go basis.
