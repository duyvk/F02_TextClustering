  [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] 
has condemned the carnage and mayhem in central Johannesburg on 
Monday, saying such chaos made an all-inclusive political 
solution less attainable. 
  "We deplore the fact that a whole city could be held hostage 
by political organisations who cannot solve their disputes 
peacefully and responsibly," said NP director of information Mr 
Marthinus van Schalkwyk. He added, however, there were too many 
differing viewpoints to form a definite picture of who started 
the carnage.
