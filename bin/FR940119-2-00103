2. Environmentally Beneficial Materials and Procedures. Projects under this category will test and evaluate the
environmental benefits of alternative materials and procedures used in the planning, design, construction, rehabilitation,
operation, and maintenance of highways. Air quality improvements and noise abatement systems for construction,
maintenance, and operations; environmentally benign materials for vegetation control and snow and ice removal;
and environmentally safe paint removal, cleaning, and application are among the hazard-free or beneficial environmental
technologies covered in this category. 
3. Materials and Techniques That Enhance Serviceability and Longevity Under Adverse Climatic, Environmental,
and Load Effects. This category of projects will include projects using materials and techniques, including design
and construction, seeking to enhance the serviceability and durability of pavements, structures, and appurtenances
under adverse environmental conditions and severe loadings. Strength enhancing additives or reinforcements,
coatings, sealers, composite designs, in situ supplements, and alternative design or construction technologies
are examples of candidates to be included in this category. 
4. Technologies That Increase Efficiency and Productivity of Vehicular Travel. This category will include projects,
both in the vehicle and on the roadway, such as traffic control devices and systems; traffic management systems, strategies,
and communications; information systems; computer-based tools that permit analysis of area-wide surface transportation
needs and operational plans; and other technologies and procedures that increase the efficiency and productivity
of vehicular travel. Technologies to be explored may include innovative sensing and information transfer technologies,
operational systems, software, and other technologies affecting vehicular travel and demand management. 
5. Technologies That Enhance Safety and Accessibility of Vehicular Transportation Systems. Projects under this
category will test and evaluate hardware, software, materials, equipment, and systems that address improved safety
and accessibility of vehicular transportation systems. Also included will be design, construction, and operational
concepts for improved safety or accessibility of vehicular transportation systems, such as guidance and control
systems, visibility and traction improvements, and network operations monitoring and control systems. 
Field Locations 
T&E projects under the ART Program are required to be incorporated in projects constructed on highways eligible
for Federal-aid. Project sites for the testing and evaluation of new technologies will be chosen to insure that an
appropriate range of traffic and operations, cultural, geographic, topographic, climatic, and other necessary
site characteristics are included in the program. 
Cost-Sharing 
The Federal share of funding for acquiring, installing, or constructing an approved T&E project will not exceed
80 percent of the costs of the technology incorporated into the project. Non-Federal funds for the matching portion
of the technologies incorporated into the project may be provided by cash payments or an equivalent value in the form
of construction services, equipment, materials, or other services or tangible goods required and used directly
for purchasing, constructing, installing, or otherwise obtaining the approved technology. In addition, the costs
for testing, data collection, evaluation, and report preparation associated with the T&E construction project
are eligible for 100 percent ART funds. 
Cost-sharing using ART funds is not available to assist small business entrepreneurs, private sector businesses,
individuals, and other private organizations in offsetting standard HITEC fees for processing and evaluation plan
development. The processing fee and evaluation plan development fees for applications submitted to HITEC by State
highway agencies are eligible for 100 percent ART funding. Funds are not available under these guidelines for general
R&D or for any technology development costs. 
Eligible Construction Costs 
Construction features and costs of T&E projects eligible for Federal cost-sharing are those found to be additional
to or different from the features and costs associated exclusively with conventional projects or technologies.
The additional costs, hereafter referred to as Delta Costs, are eligible for up to 80 percent Federal funds. Examples
of three basic categories of features which may generate Delta Costs are as follows: 
1. A replacement or substitute for a conventional technology. The Delta Costs would be the costs for the replacement
or substitute, minus the cost of the conventional technology. An example would be a new binder used as a substitute
for asphalt or portland cement. 
2. A new addition to or modification of an existing technology. In this case the Delta Costs would be the costs of the
additional technology and its incorporation in the project. An example would be the use of an asphalt modifier for
which the material cost of the modifier and the labor or equipment cost incurred in adding the modifier would constitute
the Delta Costs. If the modification of the existing technology also required an increase in the preparation, handling,
or placement costs over conventional costs, those increased costs also would be a part of the Delta Costs.
