Sharp weather concentrates the mind, and the past week raises questions of
frost and damp. Despite appearances, though, the frosts have not been so
lethal as weatherpersons inclined us to think.
I measure them by the scale of 1991 when frost at the same season damaged
many of my half-hardy plants, including penstemons, beyond recovery. This
year, their top growth is unscathed, partly because the previous weeks had
been colder and their growth had slowed already. I had also taken a
precaution, which I recommend.
Just before the freeze, I double-wrapped my marginals in that great newcomer
to garden centres, Fibre Fleece. This is a thin, white drape, like a nylon
scarf, which takes many degrees off the frost or wind while allowing water
to pass through and reach the roots of plants underneath. Now, we can wrap
up vulnerable plants without exposing them to drought or rot. Thanks to
Fibre Fleece, I still have unscorched silver convolvulus, living diascias
and last year's verbena.
Fibre Fleece comes in amply-priced packs for people with a few plants which
they treat like pets. Those with bigger gardens should look for the large
rolls at the back of the store: otherwise, they are available from such
trade suppliers of garden goods as Joseph Bentley on Humberside. Owners of
bigger gardens need to shop around.
I wish there was a similar fleecing that would cope with the problem of
damp. Between now and March, this is as much of a killer as frost, but we
hear less about it because its effects are more haphazard.
The thaw after a hard frost begins the problem. The frost upsets the fleshy
leaves on plants like the blue-flowered agapanthus; but the lethal
consequence is the damp, which then sits on the main crown and causes the
plant to rot.
The other day, I read an expert who was saying that my latest pleasures, the
late-flowering schizostylis, are not fully hardy in winter. What he means
(an expert grower assured me) is that, sometimes, they will rot away in a
wet winter or after a thaw. This weakness is widespread, not least among
plants with silver leaves.
As the frost leaves us, how are we to cope with damp? On a small scale, we
can dig grit or gravel round the roots and necks of alpines, pinks and
silver plants when first we put them into the ground. Even now, we can
usefully surround them with a layer of gravel to sharpen drainage until
spring.
On a larger scale, I find the problem more perplexing. How, for instance, do
you deal with endemic damp all over a flower bed? The only answer is to
drain it; but I have always skipped the ritual chapter on herring-bone
drains in the old gardening dictionaries. The FT forgot to check this point
before engaging me, but in those days they had the late Arthur Hellyer
instead. He had land-drained and herring-drained more square rods of soil
than any of us.
What, then, does Hellyer recommend for beds which are turning into a swamp?
His Gardening Encyclopedia (the 1993 edition is published by Hamlyn at the
remarkably low price of Pounds 14.99 for 784 pages) is clear and
uncompromising. On wet land, dig narrow trenches about 12 ft apart down to
the level where the sub-soil becomes a pan on which the water sits. I have
had a trench-digger; as a result, my future carrot bed looks like roadworks,
with a pattern of trenches in which water is now sitting or trickling.
Perfectionists would now lay drainpipes at this level, but I am not entirely
sure we have reached the level where they are most effective. The easier
option is to fill each trench with better drainage: Hellyer recommends
well-burned clinkers from a boiler because they are especially hard and
angular. No doubt clinkers would solve the problem - but, out in the modern
Cotswolds, they have given way to gas.
Certainly, a system of trenches is the answer to a poorly-drained area, but
the cheapest possibility is to trust Hellyer and choose a faggot drain
instead. This under-publicised option has much going for it. You find your
faggots, lay them end to end in the trenches, cover them with turf (placed
with the grass downwards), and then replace the topsoil to cover the burial.
'Well-made faggot drains will remain effective for years,' says Hellyer; in
our gadget-minded generation, though, most of us probably have forgotten
about them.
The question arises: where do you find a suitable faggot? Country residents
will have no problems: they need only to cut bundles of brushwood from a
hedgerow, choosing hazel wherever possible.
These bundles can be dropped into the trench, but you need to be sure the
wood is not too soft or short of side branches. Then, you surface with turf
and replace enough soil for a decent cabbage on top.
If you cannot fleece it, faggot it: damp, at least, can be drained away,
whereas frost retains the unpredictability which caught us all short this
week and makes winter survival such a hazard.
