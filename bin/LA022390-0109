<TEXT>
<P>
Making history is a roll of the dice and Virginia's new governor, Lawrence 
Douglas Wilder, knows it. This elemental lesson rises like vapor from the 
swampy, treacherous waters of the Old Dominion's politics, where the bones of 
losers are picked clean and dumped in the murky depths of oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, obscurity is the least of Democrat Wilder's worries at the moment. 
As the nation's first elected black governor -- chosen in a state that once was 
the heart and brain of the Confederacy -- he has the bright aura of an 
electoral magician. By virtue of this uniqueness, Wilder, whose cachet includes 
being the grandson of slaves, has achieved overnight national prominence while 
many of his rivals and peers continue to splash fitfully in the gloom of media 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
This day, for instance, Wilder -- dressed in an immaculate blue pinstripe suit 
and recently minus his mustache -- seems immensely telegenic, more than 
handsome enough to get a running start in public opinion polls. Moreover, he 
looks much younger than his 59 years and when he smiles or laughs -- as he does 
often -- another decade fades away, giving him the priceless political gift of 
youthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
But -- and there's always a but, isn't there? -- from the perspective of the 
state capital, Wilder claims that his seemingly unbounded future is about as 
clear as the James River that roils muddily through this city of 220,000. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he says, slouching back in his chair, relaxed and cheerful in the small 
office of the Capitol that Thomas Jefferson built, people are pressing him to 
start a "Wilder national movement." The subject came up in a meeting this very 
morning, he says, chuckling. Even so, the friend and political ally who 
broached the topic agreed that it's a "trivial" matter, he says. 
</P>
<P>
He has only been in office since Jan. 13, Wilder notes, and his four-year term 
stretches before him like unmapped territory. 
</P>
<P>
Who can tell whether he'll be on a mountain or a molehill by 1994? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a question of where you are, what have you done, where is your 
impetus, what's the stride, what's the step, what is your motivation, what is 
available, and what's possible," he explains in the cadences of a veteran stump 
speaker. "I've always believed in the art of the possible. I believe there's a 
difference between brave-heartedness and foolishness and I believe in whatever 
I'm going to do, if I don't see success somewhere through the tunnel of that 
vision, I don't even bother with it." 
</P>
<P>
These cautious words come from a politician who learned in 20 years of climbing 
to the top that personal metamorphosis and public perception are key to 
political survival -- especially in Virginia, where the faintest whisper of 
radicalism or unorthodoxy can sound like a Guns N' Roses concert. (A magazine 
writer observed during last year's campaign that Virginia's most liberal 
Democrats would be moderate Republicans anyplace else.) 
</P>
<P>
Once seen as a black activist and outsider, Wilder, a flamboyant former 
criminal defense lawyer, state senator and lieutenant governor, transformed 
himself into, as one local attorney put it, "a good old boy" who built bridges 
to white colleagues instead of burning them. Throughout the campaign last fall, 
Wilder appealed to "the new Virginia mainstream . . . that group which looks 
forward rather than behind, that builds rather than destroys and brings people 
together, rather than to divide them." 
</P>
<P>
Much of his strategy, he says, was to combat the assumption that "any Democrat 
would be a big spender. And certainly, if you are a minority, as in my case, 
that I'd be more than just a big spender and that I'd be turning the keys of 
the jails over to the prisoners and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's most liberal position during the campaign was his pro-choice stand on 
abortion, an issue believed crucial in the close race. On the other hand, 
Wilder years ago reversed his opposition to the death penalty to project a 
tough-on-crime image. 
</P>
<P>
Former Richmond Mayor Henry L. Marsh III, who roomed with Wilder at Howard 
University law school, believes that Wilder's successful balancing act in a 
conservative state with a more than 80% white electorate will bring both 
symbolic and substantial rewards to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Being governor of Virginia is like being emperor of the world," says Marsh, 
who continues to serve on the City Council. "Doug's service as governor is a 
way of overcoming a lot of historical resistance to blackness. If Doug does an 
outstanding job for all people, it breaks down a lot of barriers." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh concedes, however, "There are apprehensions among some blacks that we may 
not get much out of this except the symbolism." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Wilder's most vociferous and longtime critic in the local black 
community is Sa'ad El-Amin, a radical lawyer. El-Amin -- who concedes he is 
practically a minority of one in criticizing the governor -- charges that 
Wilder, with his links to conservative Democrats such as Virginia's U.S. Sen. 
Charles Robb, will be used to "sell" a rightward-shifting party to blacks on a 
national level. "The good old boys will have their cake and eat it too," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
In general, though, the prevailing moods in the state range between euphoria 
and pleased surprise, Marsh says. "Some people feel sort of amazed that it's 
working out and maybe this guy isn't too bad after all." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agrees that Wilder has never been afraid of taking a stand or applying 
pressure. Two oft-cited examples are his campaign to change the state song, 
"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny," because of the lyric "this ol' darkie's 
heart," and his ultimately successful battle to make the Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr.'s birthday a state holiday. To win the holiday fight, Wilder agreed to 
a compromise that shared the King holiday with Confederate Generals Robert E. 
Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Nonetheless, insiders paint Wilder as an adroit 
behind-the-scenes worker with a stubborn streak that can drive opponents to 
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
But now that he has won the governor's chair -- and by the narrow margin of 
fewer than 7,000 votes at that -- Wilder believes that he must be doubly 
careful not to let the elation of victory lead him into the temptations of 
foolish pride. 
</P>
<P>
"If I fail or say things that people could say, 'Well, I told you so,' it would 
set a lot of things back and that would be more detrimental to me in terms of 
what I had in mind than anything I know," he says. 
</P>
<P>
This attitude finds favor in an office not far from Wilder's, that of A.L. 
Philpott, 33 years a member of the House of Delegates and Speaker of the House 
for 12. A white-haired, pipe-smoking former segregationist who drew the line at 
closing the state's public schools during "massive resistance" to integration 
in the 1950s, Philpott gives Wilder grudging but sincere credit for being a 
smart politician. 
</P>
<P>
The new governor is "a highly intelligent person who is unlikely to make any 
foolish mistakes," Philpott says. In some quarters, Wilder was "expected to 
fall flat on his face" almost as soon as he was sworn in, Philpott continues, 
noting that Wilder has "disappointed" these expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Philpott readily acknowledges that "Doug and I haven't always been the best of 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
This turns out to be something of an understatement. Wilder and Philpott were 
once political enemies, so much so that Wilder threatened to work for 
Philpott's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Philpott, who has a record of getting himself in hot water for 
racial gaffes, who threw a 1985 breakfast to introduce Wilder, then running for 
lieutenant governor, to politicos on his home turf. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Philpott is optimistic about what Wilder will do for the 
state. "I think it's going to have a very positive effect on the political and 
social life of Virginia," he says of Wilder's governorship. He finally puts a 
match to the pipe he has been toying with. "Perhaps we can get rid of some of 
that image that we're rednecks stuck in the 1820s." 
</P>
<P>
And yet Philpott apparently still can't quite believe that Wilder outmatched 
everyone to become governor, an office more coveted and revered in Virginia 
than the Presidency of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He expected Marshall Coleman, Wilder's Republican opponent, to win the 
election, he says, noting that many Democrats told him they were sitting out 
the election because they would not vote for a black man. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Philpott says he did not give credence to widely publicized polls 
that showed Wilder winning by several percentage points, when, in fact, he 
squeaked into office. The polls were the subject of a post-election controversy 
over whether and why voters lie in opinion surveys about race. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe it when we nominated him for lieutenant governor," Philpott 
says. "I didn't even believe it when we nominated him for governor." 
</P>
<P>
Philpott's comment accents the tension between change and tradition -- both 
good and bad -- in this state of 6 million. The capital city itself seems to 
symbolize that tension. 
</P>
<P>
While Virginians talk proudly of the state's rapid growth and its attendant 
rush into modern times, to a Los Angeles resident, Richmond seems a city 
steeped in the past, a town of red brick buildings where the 19th and 18th 
centuries are enshrined and made palpable. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost impossible to walk down the street without rubbing against a plaque 
commemorating a historic house or skirting around a statue honoring a native 
son for greatness in battle or statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this is a city of statues. One major street, Monument Avenue, is 
devoted to the display of sculpted likenesses of major Confederates. The only 
one not on a horse is Jefferson Davis, the luckless president of the 
secessionist states. Generals Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and J. E. B. 
Stuart tower over the politician in bronze meldings of men and horse flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, there's another telling measure of the veneration of the past. 
One of the city's most expensive restaurants proudly occupies a former stable 
that supposedly sheltered Lee's faithful mount, Traveller. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Marsh says that the celebrations of Confederate heroes are 
generally accepted by local blacks, noting that the council recently 
appropriated money to refurbish the statues on Monument Avenue. Marsh is quick 
to point out, too, that Richmond contains its share of landmarks that are 
important to black people. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much history in the air," he says, gesturing outside his law 
offices to the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Though much less visible, these shards of black history were part of the 
consciousness he and Wilder shared as they grew up in a totally segregated 
city, Marsh says. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among them is Richmond's Jackson Ward area, a neighborhood that was a 
center of black "intellectual thought and innovation from Reconstruction to the 
1920s," he explains. The area contains the "oldest black insurance company in 
the country and the oldest black bank in the country," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Ward also has at least one statue, a tribute to Bill (Bojangles) 
Robinson, the famed tap dancer who was born in the neighborhood in 1878. 
</P>
<P>
But Richmond's chief shrine is the state Capitol itself, a 1785 building 
designed by Jefferson along the lines of a classical temple. Here, under the 
rotunda, stands Houdon's famous statue of George Washington, object of a 
thousand school group tours. Here, too, is the home of the Virginia General 
Assembly, "the oldest legislative body in the Western hemisphere," a local 
guidebook informs. 
</P>
<P>
And it is with the living politicians of the Legislature that Wilder will have 
to work his magic if he is to move beyond the boundaries of the state. 
</P>
<P>
In town for a 60-day session, legislators can usually be identified by the lack 
of attention they pay to the Capitol building's artistic tributes to 
politicians of yore. Preoccupied by the business of the present, Virginia's 
representatives hurry by the paintings and sculptures as if to say, "Those guys 
will never have to run for reelection again." 
</P>
<P>
The governor and Speaker Philpott claim that the session has gone well -- 
despite the budget crunch that led Wilder to call for establishing a 
$200-million reserve against revenue shortfalls. Indeed, Wilder drew bipartisan 
praise last month for his fiscally tough State of the Commonwealth Address that 
promised no tax increases. One legislator told the Richmond News Leader, "The 
people in this state that were worried about a liberal governor have had their 
fears allayed." (The 1990-92 $26-billion state budget is largely the work of 
Wilder's predecessor. Virginia's governors get only one crack at a budget they 
fully can call their own, the spending plan they concoct for their final two 
years in office.) 
</P>
<P>
But Wilder and Philpott are fuming over a Feb. 1 News Leader article, based 
largely on anonymous sources, that characterized Wilder as getting a grade of 
"D . . . for disinvolvement" with the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder says he told one legislator quoted in the story, "If everything I'm 
going to say to you is going to be in the press, then let me write it out and 
give it to you and put it in the press." He adds that in a speech to the local 
press he told reporters, "I always know exactly who that anonymous source is 
and I know exactly why they're anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Wilder -- and his calls for fiscal austerity -- again took jabs from 
the press with reports that his new Lincoln limousine costs well above the 
price of his predecessor's official transportation, a Cadillac -- $37,923 vs. 
$19,949. Wilder's office blamed the difference on the rise in car prices and a 
drop in trade values. But, traditionally, Virginia's governors get new cars. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's sensitivity to some publicity may stem from earlier media 
exposure of his warts. Since entering public life in 1969, Wilder has weathered 
a number of personal controversies. These include his apparently stormy 1978 
divorce, late payment of property taxes, his former ownership of a run-down 
vacant house that neighbors contended was a public nuisance and a reprimand 
from the Virginia Supreme Court for procrastinating in a personal injury suit. 
</P>
<P>
None of these matters, including a $52,000 property settlement won by his 
ex-wife, ever seriously damaged Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh says his friend seems to share a "Teflon" political trait with another 
politician. "I think he possesses a Reagan-like quality of being able to 
overcome these kinds of obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wilder demonstrated a capacity for candor in revealing interviews 
with biographer Donald P. Baker, chief of the Washington Post's Richmond 
bureau. Among other things, in numerous long sessions with Baker, Korean war 
veteran Wilder recounted that one of 20 North Korean prisoners he had helped 
capture was killed by a fellow American soldier as the two escorted their 
charges into captivity. Wilder was awarded a bronze star in the action at Pork 
Chop Hill, which included throwing grenades into bunkers to drive the enemy 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Baker says he still doesn't know if the governor has read all of "Wilder: Hold 
Fast to Dreams," published last fall. But Baker says Wilder had gotten an early 
copy to peruse "the bad chapters." 
</P>
<P>
The biography also paints a charming picture of Wilder growing up in modest but 
adequate circumstances in Richmond's Church Hill neighborhood. Wilder is the 
next to youngest of eight children, and as a youngster, his favorite chore was 
chopping heads off chickens bound for the family table. Since then, he has come 
a long way financially. He is thought to be a millionaire, thanks to his legal 
skill and a sharp eye for real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder himself maintains that that all the skeletons in his closet have been 
exterminated. "I told the press the other day . . . that the only reason that 
anything hasn't been printed about me is that people just didn't know it," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the embarrassments of the past and the current troubles of black 
politicians Marion Barry and Tom Bradley, Wilder says he willingly accepts the 
goldfish-bowl aspect of public life. 
</P>
<P>
"It is in a bowl and I don't think you should complain about it because you can 
get out of that bowl any time you want. . . . If you're going to lead, you do 
what the tautology demands -- you set forth, you move out," he says. "You can't 
afford to fall down to the extent that you say, 'Well, why don't you treat me 
like everybody else?' I don't think it's a double standard and I don't think 
its an invidious standard." 
</P>
<P>
On a less lofty level, Wilder says that his unmarried state makes him a target 
for social joshing. "I get chided about that every evening at some reception," 
he says. "Someone will say, 'Well who's going to be the First Lady or hostess 
at the mansion?' " The social fate of Virginia is not in the balance, he adds, 
because "we have a mansion staff." 
</P>
<P>
His marital state could change, too, he suggests. "I'm not a confirmed 
bachelor. I just happen to be one," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back from the vantage point of the governor's office, Wilder takes 
pride in his life, all of it spent in Richmond except for stints of higher 
education and military service. 
</P>
<P>
"You see some people who say, 'I know him, he used to shine my shoes,' " he 
says, laughing again. "You see the next guy and he says, 'Yeah, we were raised 
together and we're very pleased.' I think it means more to me to show what 
could happen in Richmond by being here. . . . I always believed that many of 
the greatest gains people would achieve would be right in their own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's son, Lawrence Douglas Wilder Jr., a lawyer in his father's firm, says 
that as a parent the governor was "definitely stern but not unfair." For 
himself and his two sisters, Wilder always insisted that schoolwork and chores 
took precedence over play. "He doesn't tolerate fools lightly," Wilder Jr. 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing his father, the son says: "He is his own man, period. It's a constant 
about him. He is himself. He is very direct. He will say what's on his mind, I 
don't care who it is. . . . What you see is what you get." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the governor's office, Wilder admits that his career has left him 
vulnerable in one area -- guiding his son's future. His remarks may also say 
something about the personal price of political life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Lawrence Jr.) has this latent desire to get involved in politics," 
Wilder says. "I don't know whether he should or not. I mean, if I were to run 
it for him, I think I would want him to just do well in terms of his law 
practice and live a more comfortable life." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder chuckles briefly. "I would never tell him that because I think he's 
already got his mind set on something like that. How could I tell him: Don't do 
it?" 
</P>
