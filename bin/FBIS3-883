  [Text] Another summit is taking place in Ndjamena, where 
the Chadian president has raised the alarm to rescue the UDEAC 
[Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa]. Here are more 
details from Dieudonne Jonabaye: 
  [Begin Jonabaye recording] On opening the 29th summit of 
countries belonging to the Customs and Economic Union of Central 
Africa, UDEAC, the Chadian president, Idriss Deby, lanced the 
boil which has been sapping the Union for years, namely the 
failure of member states to pay their dues while the very same 
states had agreed to put the functioning of the Union on a 
respectable footing. The Chadian president also said, and I 
quote: Recent events force us to move faster towards the 
creation of a genuine economic and monetary union. 
  According to reliable sources close to the presidency, 
presidents present in Ndjamena and the representative of the 
Equatorial Guinean president are determined to sign the treaty 
creating the community. The same sources indicated that the 
representative of the Cameroonian president reportedly declared 
that he had no mandate from his president to sign the Treaty. 
This is Dieudonne Jonabaye reporting from RFI. [end recording]
