  [Text] Johannesburg March 23 SAPA -- The Human Rights 
Commission [HRC] said in a statement on Wednesday [23 March] 180 
people died in political violence in Natal in February. 
Although this was lower than the number recorded in the closing 
months of 1993, the HRC noted that passions were running high in 
the province and that continued attacks had created a high level 
of frustration and tension. 
  The HRC said the Midlands area had witnessed the most deaths 
with 64 killings. There were four major attacks in the area. 
At Richmond 12 people were killed in a single attack and at 
Creighton 15 African National Congress supporters were killed. 
  In the greater Durban area there were 54 deaths; in northern 
Natal five; 44 on the north coast; and 13 on the south coast.
