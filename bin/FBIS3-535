<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Possible Clinton Whitwatergate Cover-Up? -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR in English on 9 March in a page-14 editorial says "the 
virtues of Bill Clinton were being sung not long ago," but, "as 
so often in the past, America's heroes are shown up to have feet 
of clay." "There can be no doubt that what is called 
Whitewatergate is becoming unsavoury, but whether it's another 
Watergate -- the cover-up that brought down President Nixon in 
1973 -- only time will tell." President Clinton has assured 
Americans that his wife's "'moral compass is as strong as 
anybody's in the country'" but "clouding matters is a series of 
secret meetings on Whitewatergate between Treasury and White 
House staffers. Clinton had better hope that he will not be 
caught out on his 'no cover-up' promise." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Bophuthatswana `Fiefdom is Crumbling' -- "Only last month, 
the Bophuthatswana president was offered an opportunity by 
Nelson Mandela to surrender with dignity the sham independence 
his territory has enjoyed since 1977," notes a page-10 editorial 
in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 March. Now 
President Mangope's "fiefdom is crumbling." "The only question 
is whether he will allow it to do so without bloodshed." 
"Mangope will probably not even listen to his old friend and 
ally [Foreign Minister] Pik Botha, who put on his usual 
performance of sweet reasonableness when he urged Mangope to 
face reality. Botha is now at pains to `forget' that it was he 
who ensured that troops were sent in four years ago to prop up 
Mangope when he was last threatened by internal resistance. 
With only 50 days left in office, Botha has neither the will 
nor the resources to repeat his mistake." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  `Dilly-Dallying' Over Election Participation -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 9 March in a page-8 editorial says 
"rightwing groups are still dilly-dallying" about participation 
in the election, in Bophuthatswana "things are rapidly falling 
apart," while the National Party and the government "are 
lukewarm about international mediation to break the negotiations 
logjam." It is now time to "recognise the force represented by 
the vast majority of South Africa's people, who want to proceed 
with the poll from 26-28 April. Parties, groups and has-been 
bantustan politicians deliberately clouding the issues and 
placing stumbling blocks are toying with this force at their own 
peril."
