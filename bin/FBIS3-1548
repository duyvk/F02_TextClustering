  [Text] Elections will be held again in Oti constituency, 
the first constituency. The constitutional chamber of the 
Supreme Court of Togo, which met on 25 March, invalidated the 
election on 6 February of Bemba Bahissa, the candidate of the 
Togolese Union for Democracy. The reason given by the Supreme 
Court is that his alternate, Tiamoko Seydou, did not meet the 
conditions concerning residence in Togo as envisaged by the 
electoral code. The protest was filed by (Assabou Gyabite), 
candidate of the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT]. According 
to the electoral code, a new election must be held within one 
month at the latest. In the same judgement, the Supreme Court 
rejected other demands for annulment -- a total of 20 -- which 
were made by the RPT, the Union for Labor and Justice, the Union 
for Renewal and Development Party, and the Togolese Democratic 
Party following the first round of the legislative elections. 
  The Supreme Court will also have to deliberate the RPT's 
contesting of the results of the second round of the legislative 
elections in seven constituencies. The probable deadline for 
the verdict is 1 April.
