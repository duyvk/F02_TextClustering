Three animal-rights protesters, who ended their weeklong occupation of a huge 
construction crane in Berkeley, face misdemeanor trespassing charges, a 
University of California spokesman said. But UC Berkeley spokesman Ray Kolvig 
said the three could also face felony charges if damage to the crane is found 
to exceed $1,000. Kolvig said the stunt, to protest construction of a new 
animal research facility on campus, cost the university and construction 
companies an estimated $30,000 a day by disrupting work on a new genetics and 
plant research building.
