In response to these comments, Sect.295.5 has been modified to increase the weight of the "level of commitment"
to 20 percent, the level that exists in the regulation as it was promulgated in 1990. The weight given "experience
and qualifications" has been reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent. 
Section 295.8(a) Patent Rights_(40 Comments)
Forty comments were received concerning the proposed revision to Sect.295.8(a)(1), thirty-nine from universities
and other nonprofit organizations opposed to the proposal, and one from a business supporting the proposal. Also,
twenty-three of the thirty-nine commentors described above objected to the definition of "United States-owned
company" found in Sect.295.2(r) of the proposed rule. 
The term "United States-owned company" defined in Sect.295.2(r) is used in Sect.295.8(a)(1) to determine who
is eligible to obtain title inventions arising from assistance under ATP. The definition states that an entity must
be organized for profit-making purposes to be deemed a United States-owned company, and Sect.295.8(a)(1) states
that only United States-owned companies may take title to inventions arising under the ATP. Taken together, the two
sections prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from obtaining title to inventions arising under
the ATP. 
The thirty-nine universities and nonprofit commentors are strongly opposed to this outcome. The following objection
is typical: "The ATP legislation enables universities to participate in research funded through the program, and
(we have) taken advantage of the opportunity to do so. However, the problem is that NIST has interpreted the ATP legislation
to exclude universities from ownership of intellectual property resulting from ATP funded research." 
In the view of NIST, the decision to prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from taking title to inventions
is embedded in statute, and NIST has no alternative but to follow the law as it presently is written. As a result of comments
received from both for-profit and nonprofit organizations, NIST recognizes that one ingredient for the successful
implementation of joint ventures under ATP is a flexible patent policy. The participants in ATP joint ventures need
the flexibility to determine for themselves the best means of commercializing the technology they develop. This,
in turn, requires the flexibility to allocate intellectual property rights as the joint ventures best see fit. Accordingly,
NIST is working with the Congress in an attempt to enact a patent policy for ATP that leaves the decisions on patent ownership
to joint venture members. Should a change in the law be enacted, NIST would immediately implement it. In that case,
NIST would rely on the ATP proposal evaluation criteria to assess the probability of subsequent commercialization
based on the proposed intellectual property rights arrangement. 
Section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)) states that intellectual
property rights developed under ATP "shall vest in a company or companies incorporated in the United States." In
reaching the conclusion that the term "company or companies" refers to profit-making entities, NIST has been guided
by the broader context of changes made to the ATP by the American Technology Preeminence Act. NIST believes that it
was the intent of Congress to provide title to inventions directly to U.S. companies as the most effective means of
assuring that research results enter the marketplace rapidly, and in the way most beneficial to United States businesses.
In this context, NIST notes that the Act contains a new requirement that "joint research and development ventures"
funded by ATP must be industry-led. NIST also notes the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to nonprofit
independent research organizations. (See sections 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively, of the American
Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)). 
Thus, NIST believes that the only reasonable reading of section 201(c)(6) is to interpret the term "United States-owned
company" as referring to businesses, and specifically, to for-profit entities.
