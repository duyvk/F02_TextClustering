Suffering from historical amnesia, many Angelenos continue to view Latinos as 
foreigners. I have heard people question the current Latino suit against the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors: why should "Mexicans" have 
representation on the board? Whites and blacks both seem to think that civil 
rights is not a Latino issue. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians must know that this area once belonged to Mexico. What 
they apparently don't know is the history that draws a continuous link between 
what happened after the United States took all of the Southwest from Mexico and 
today's shutout of Latino Americans from the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Our schools regularly teach about the social injustices suffered by blacks in 
the South and by European immigrants in the Eastern cities. Few history courses 
mention unjust laws directed against Latinos, such as the infamous "Greaser 
Act," a California anti-vagrancy law. El Clamor Publico, a newspaper published 
here in the 1850s, is full of accounts of lynchings and racial injustices 
toward Mexicans, but it is seldom seen in any course of study, nor is editor 
Francisco Ramirez's call for a "Back to Mexico" movement. 
</P>
<P>
The flood of Easterners, brought by the railroads in the 1880s, seems to have 
swept away all evidence of the Latino past. This is distressing. Los Angeles 
was built by the labor of Mexicans who had to live segregated in enclaves, 
attending separate schools and even separate churches. From the beginning, they 
formed self-help groups, labor associations and libraries in an effort to 
change this inequality. They gathered in the old plaza at Olvera Street, 
organizing against injustices in Mexico and Los Angeles. They held this 
political space in the face of incessant police sweeps, eventually forcing 
local authorities to designate free-speech areas in the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in L.A.'s history is the forced repatriation of more than 75,000 Mexicans, 
a majority of them U.S.-born children, during the Great Depression. Or the fact 
that lawful school segregation was ended in California in a 1946 suit (Mendez 
vs. Westminster School District) filed by Mexicans in Orange County. 
</P>

Because of Luis Valdez's play, some Angelenos know about the Sleepy Lagoon 
murder case (1942) and the zoot-suit riots (1943). Fewer are familiar with 
Latino contributions during the war years: Ysmael R. Villegas of the Casablanca 
colonia of Riverside and David Gonzales of Pacoima were posthumously awarded 
the Medal of Honor. Guy Lou Gabaldon, raised on the Eastside, single-handedly 
captured over 1,000 Japanese soldiers on Saipan. In the Korean War, the medal 
was awarded to Eugene A. Obregon of Los Angeles (posthumously) and Joseph C. 
Rodriguez of San Bernardino. In all, 17 Mexican Americans received this highest 
military honor for valor during those wars while thousands more gave their 
lives in defense of a country that saw them as foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of empowerment, in 1949 Mexican Americans elected Edward R. Roybal 
to the Los Angeles City Council. Roybal's civil-rights record has no equal in 
the city's history, where he led the fight for fair employment and against 
urban renewal and police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Roybal after that demonstrates the mistakes that can be made 
when a city ignores its history. Democratic Party leaders lost a golden 
opportunity to forge a liberal black and Latino political coalition when they 
abandoned Roybal in his 1958 supervisorial race, in which he was the victim of 
widespread voter intimidation and fraud. When Roybal was elected to Congress in 
1962, Westside liberals appointed Gilbert Lindsay, a black, to his place on the 
City Council, then redrew that district, making it impossible for a Latino to 
be elected to the council for another next 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing society through a black-white television screen, white liberals 
excluded Latinos from early anti-poverty programs. Only the militancy of 
Chicano youth in the latter part of the '60s forced a re-evaluation. It was not 
until 1970 that Latinos were classified as an "identifiable ethnic minority 
with a pattern of discrimination." A consequence of historical amnesia is that 
it encourages the invention of a false reality, perpetuating the illusion of 
social and political equality. According to Julian Nava, who was on the Los 
Angeles school board from 1967 to 1979, the critical under-servicing of Latinos 
is a result of their under-representation. Alan Clayton, formerly of the L. A. 
County Chicano Employees Assn., estimates that just over 18% of the county's 
work force is Latino, while their projected population is about 35%. 
</P>
<P>
When considering their community, Angelenos should remember that they do not 
live in New York or Atlanta or Washington, D.C. Undoubtedly, a remapping of the 
county supervisor districts threatens many interest groups. But, as Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. once said, injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere. Equality 
cannot be achieved by maintaining a political underclass in the city of Nuestra 
Senora la Reina de Los Angeles.
