Mr Keith Jones, managing director of Henrob, a small company based in Wales,
was flying to Detroit yesterday to talk with US manufacturers about applying
its self-piercing riveting technology 'which every month is gaining
momentum'.
Its partnership with German carmaker Audi marks the first application of the
technology, which replaces spot welding, to a complete car body assembly.
The machines and rivets installed at Audi's Ingolstadt plant have all been
designed and manufactured in Flint.
Henrob, Mr Jones said, had been 'pushing' its technology for some time, but
everyone was comfortable with spot welding.
'Then the technology changed, with aluminium and plastic coming in as the
need has grown for lighter vehicles. At that point, they (Audi) realised
that welding wasn't suitable - and at that point it became really exciting
for us.'
Henrob is already active in other fields - about 1,000 of its riveting
machines are installed worldwide in applications such as washing-machine
assembly lines in Iran and India. The electronically operated sliding roof
of Toronto's all-weather sports stadium is held together by Henrob's system.
In the motor industry the catalyst for the surge of interest has been the
prospect of aluminium cars being produced in volume.
But manufacturers are realising that the technology is applicable to steel
as well, particularly as they move to corrosion-resistant coated steels.
Spot welding can destroy the coating and leave the vehicle vulnerable to
rusting.
Ford US, in a research paper presented to the International Body Engineering
Conference in Detroit in September, said: 'Only the self-piercing rivet
shows a significant strength advantage over spot welds.'
The size of the potential market is enormous. Mr Jones said: 'There are
about 130bn spot welds put into cars each year - an average of 3,000 per
vehicle.'
There is no heat involved in the new process, so it can join unlike
materials, such as the plastic composite body panels some vehicle makers are
using as an alternative to steel.
Other advantages claimed are low energy consumption compared with the hefty
electrical current required for welding, near-noiseless operation and only
about half the investment.
But Henrob executives accept that the motor industry's need to amortise
large investments in spot-welding plant and equipment makes an 'overnight'
switch to pierce riveting unlikely.
The French Peugeot group is also introducing a simpler form of the
technology to assemble part of the body shell of its 106 and 306 car ranges.
A simplified form of the process is being used to assemble seats for Ford's
new Mondeo model.
Only 68 per cent of joints on the Audi aluminium car are riveted because the
design of the car was under way when Henrob was approached. 'Now that the
technology has been accepted future cars will be designed with it in mind
from the start, bringing it much closer to 100 per cent,' Mr Jones said.
Henrob set up in Flint in 1986 - helped by a Pounds 500,000 grant from the
Welsh Office - after acquiring technology rights which originated in
Australia.
It is investing Pounds 1.8m in expansion and creating 20 jobs in addition to
the current 34. Mr Jones predicted 'significant' further growth in
employment.
The company has enjoyed a 40 per cent growth in turnover this year 'and
we're expecting 80 per cent compound over the next three years,' Mr Jones
said. 'Audi isn't even on stream yet.'
Henrob exports more than 80 per cent of the output of its small Flint plant,
which produces several million rivets of varying size each week.
