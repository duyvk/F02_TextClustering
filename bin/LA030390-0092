<TEXT>
<P>
President Daniel Arap Moi has banned all demonstrations in Kenya following 
anti-government riots caused by the mysterious death of Foreign Minister Robert 
J. Ouko two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators, accusing the government of trying to cover up the apparent 
murder of Ouko near his home last month, clashed with police in Nairobi and the 
western town of Kisumu before his burial last week. Local press reports said at 
least one person in Kisumu died after being beaten by riot police. 
</P>
<P>
The government, aided by British detectives, has launched an investigation to 
try to identify Ouko's killers.
