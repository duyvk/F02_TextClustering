Question: Which is considered the more difficult feat: winning the Triple Crown 
in the United States, when the three races are contested over a period of five 
weeks, or winning it in England, with the three races spread out over more than 
three months? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There is a divergence of opinion among professionals. Some feel the 
concentration of pressure involved in the American Triple Crown places a 
fearsome burden on a horse. Others feel it is more difficult to keep a horse in 
top condition for the longer period of time involved in the English Triple 
Crown. Suffice to say, both series are difficult to sweep. There have been 11 
winners of the U.S. Triple Crown since Sir Barton was the first in 1919. 
Affirmed, in 1978, was the last. West Australian was the first to sweep the 
English Triple Crown (the 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and St. Leger) in 1853, and 
15 horses have done it. The last was Nijinsky II in 1970, and he was the first 
since Bahram in 1935. The English Triple Crown does not seem to hold the same 
appeal for horsemen in that country these days as the American Triple Crown 
among horsemen in this country.

Q: I am fascinated by the distinction made between races at a mile and a 16th 
and races at a mile and 70 yards. The two distances are so close together, for 
a mile and a 16th is a mile and 110 yards. Why do tracks offer both distances 
when they are almost the same thing? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is often a matter of psychology. The racing secretary is trying to 
attract the best possible racing material for his programs. Some trainers may 
feel that their horse doesn't have the stamina to stay a mile and a 16th but 
might be able to win at a mile and 70 yards. Department stores practice the 
same psychology by pricing items at $99, rather than $100. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When I handicap the races, I compare the best previous times of the horses 
in that race at the distance in question. Some of my friends discount the best 
time as having little significance. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A: "The quality of the race can make a difference," said Leroy Jolley, the Hall 
of Fame trainer who saddled Kentucky Derby winners Foolish Pleasure and Genuine 
Risk. "Cheap horses are not consistent and can turn in a good time one day and 
a slow time the next. In some instances they are favored by certain track 
conditions, or perhaps they can get an easy lead in some races and nurse it all 
the way. Good horses, on the other hand, hold their form longer, and if they 
run in fast time, they are more likely to run back in comparable time than 
cheap horses. Not all the time, but more often. Thus, in better races, the best 
times are probably more significant."

Q: Like many others, I have read many stories and am concerned about the number 
of fractures occurring among our racehorses. Isn't it possible to alleviate 
this situation to some degree by feeding a heavier calcium diet to horses, thus 
building stronger bone? 
</P>
<P>
A: "In the absence of a marked deficiency of calcium in the body makeup, it has 
been proven to the satisfaction of most professionals that a high calcium diet 
is not effective in the prevention of fractures in racehorses," said the noted 
Midwestern veterinarian, Dr. Robert Copeian. "Levels of calcium above the norm 
are rejected by the body."
