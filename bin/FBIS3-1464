  [Text] Police have warned the members of the public to stay 
away from Louis Botha Avenue as thousands of Zulus are returning 
to Alexandria via this route. Members of the public have been 
asked to avoid Wolhuter and Koch Streets. At least 2,000 Zulus 
are currently gathering at the George Goch Station where they 
are being addressed by Zulu leaders. Another large group of 
marchers are waiting for trains at the Jeppe Station. 
  People believed to have been injured during the march are 
streaming into Johannesburg and Hillbrow Hospitals, and the 
situation in both hospitals is said to be chaotic. A spokesman 
for the Johannesburg Hospital said the victims were suffering 
from gunshot and sjambok wounds, and multiple injuries. 
  Altogether 42 people were admitted by the casualty section 
of 
Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto following violence in the area. 
A spokesperson said 30 of those admitted had bullet wounds and 
three people were in a critical condition, the other 12 were 
stabbed, beaten or had been struck by motor vehicles.
