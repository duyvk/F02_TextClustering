7. Establish Procedures to Verify That the HACCP System Is 
Working 
This process involves: (1) Verifying that the critical 
limits are adequate to control the hazards; (2) ensuring that the 
HACCP plan is working properly, e.g., that it is being followed, 
and that appropriate decisions are being made about corrective 
actions; and (3) ensuring that there is documented, periodic 
revalidation of the plan to make sure that it is still relevant 
to raw materials as well as to conditions and processes in the 
plant. Government regulatory activities also help ensure that 
the HACCP system is working. 
B. Specific Applications to Seafood 
As NAS has pointed out, most health risks associated with 
seafood originate in the environment (Ref. 7, p. 1). Many of 
these risks are the subject of research by FDA, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department 
of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
others. This research is designed both to produce information 
that will provide a better understanding of the toxins, bacteria, 
chemical contaminants, and other phenomena and to provide a basis 
for developing more advanced types of controls for them. Within 
the limits of existing scientific knowledge, however, the 
industry can and should use HACCP to control the source and 
condition of raw materials based on an understanding of the 
likely hazards that need to be prevented. 
The Pillsbury team that first applied HACCP to food 
production began with a systematic review of raw materials to 
ensure that they were not bringing hazards into the plant. As 
Bauman pointed out: 
This required the development of a 
familiarity with the raw materials that was 
not a normal process in food product 
development * * *. The areas of concern 
ranged from the potential presence of 
pathogens, heavy metals, toxins, physical 
hazards and chemicals, to the type of 
treatments the ingredients might have 
received such as pesticide applications or a 
pasteurization step. (Ref. 33, pp. 2 and 3.) 
 
While all these areas that were of concern to Pillsbury are not 
germane to all seafoods, they certainly cover the range of 
hazards to which seafoods are susceptible. 
Of the three most frequently reported seafood-related 
illnesses, two are environmentally related: ciguatera in warm 
water reef fish, as described previously, and water-borne viruses 
in molluscan shellfish consumed raw and partially cooked. While 
a rapid test to detect ciguatoxin in fish continues to be the 
target of research at FDA and elsewhere, processors and importers 
can exercise control by ensuring that they are obtaining fish 
from responsible sources that are not harvesting from waters 
where ciguatoxin is being found. 
Ciguatera has been associated with recreational fishing. 
Processors and importers should address through HACCP any safety 
considerations that might exist with the commercial sale of 
recreational catch generally, depending upon species and locale. 
For viruses from molluscan shellfish to be controlled, HACCP 
measures must be in place to ensure that molluscan shellfish 
harvested from polluted waters are not entering commerce. Other 
key safety controls relate to proper refrigeration to keep 
potentially harmful microbes from reaching dangerous levels. 
The third seafood-related illness, scombroid poisoning, is 
caused by a toxin created as part of the process of decomposition 
after a fish has died. The formation of scombrotoxin can be 
triggered by time/temperature abuse anywhere in the commercial 
system and beyond, including as early as on the harvesting vessel 
if good handling controls are not followed. 
FDA is considering whether to develop good handling practice 
requirements (not necessarily HACCP) specific to fishing vessels 
and invites comment on this matter. FDA has traditionally 
refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels, largely 
because of the huge number of such vessels in the U.S. fleet, 
even though it has authority to do so. FDA invites comment on 
whether those boats that harvest scombrotoxin-forming species, or 
any other specific component of the fleet, should be subject to 
mandatory HACCP controls.
