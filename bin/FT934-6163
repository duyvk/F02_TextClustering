deal

A consortium of seven Japanese companies has won a contract worth an
estimated Dollars 500m to Dollars 600m (Pounds 340m to Pounds 408m) to
supply equipment for a new steel production facility at the Baoshan complex,
near Shanghai.
The Japanese group, headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi
Corporation, signed a contract at the weekend, despite a long history of
problems at the plant, touted as China's largest industrial project when
conceived two decades ago.
Members of the consortium say they have been told by the Chinese partner not
to release details of the contract, but the companies will supply equipment
for a hot-rolled steel sheet facility capable of producing 2.8m tonnes a
year.
The Baoshan plant was plagued by problems after its conception, and a decade
ago Japanese companies suffered when contracts to supply equipment were
renegotiated by the Chinese government.
Construction schedules had to be revised because the marshy plant site was
far softer than estimated in a feasibility study and extra foundation work
was necessary to stop the facility from sinking.
Equipment exported from Japan was designed to process higher-grade ore than
was generally found in China, forcing Baoshan to import more Australian ore
than was planned. Meanwhile, the site's port was too shallow for large ore
carriers to dock, forcing them to unload down river, increasing the
transport costs.
'We think we will have no problems this time,' one of the Japanese companies
said. Apart from MHI and Mitsubishi Corporation, the consortium includes
Mitsubishi Electric, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Nippon Steel,
Chugai Ro, an industrial furnace maker, and Ube Industries, a chemicals and
machinery producer
It is understood that Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex corporation, which has
traditionally relied on investment funds from the state, will be responsible
for raising much of the finance for the expansion, to be completed in late
1996.
The Baoshan complex produced 6.3m tonnes of steel last year, and is expected
to increase its output to 10m tonnes by 2000, as part of a national plan to
lift steel production from 80m tonnes last year to 100m tonnes by the
century's end.
