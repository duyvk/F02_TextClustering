</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year is 2000, and Prof. Bradford in Berkeley is desperately trying to pull 
together a last-minute lecture on deforestation of the Amazon for his 4:15 
class. He flips on his notebook-sized computer and starts talking, ordering 
libraries of research papers, a few animated charts and even some help directly 
from a colleague across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The computer, a revolutionary device by any standard, doesn't exist today 
except in a slick, six-minute video produced by Apple Computer Inc. to 
illustrate what Chairman John Sculley calls a vision of "my technology" for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Apple's corporate campus, which resembles nothing less than a 
yuppie theme park for bright young MBAs and computer engineers, the technology 
powering the company's awesome spurt to a $5-billion-a-year operation isn't 
significantly different from the original Macintosh personal computer Apple 
introduced five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies Apple's central dilemma: It wants to get to the 21st Century 
with real revolutionary products, not merely "vision rollouts" of devices such 
as Prof. Bradford's "Knowledge Navigator" computer in a notebook. But at the 
same time, analysts say, it seems reluctant -- or perhaps unable -- to break 
away from the Macintosh and go beyond simply refining a hit product line. 
</P>
<P>
Similar challenges face other high-tech companies, but it is keenly felt 
especially at Apple because the stakes go far beyond the traditional methods of 
score-keeping, such as sales, earnings and market share. Perhaps more important 
to many inside the company is the desire to protect the company's 
well-burnished reputation for risk taking, visionary spirit and technological 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
But so far Apple has failed to satisfy even some of its staunchest supporters 
that its technology goals will have a life much beyond videotape. And some 
observers are not sure that the company even wants to break out of the comfort 
of the Mac pack. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there were more science and less science fiction," complains Richard A. 
Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter. "I don't have any sense from 
Apple that there is the great vision from the top." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Esther Dyson, a software newsletter publisher: "I get the sense that the 
top management doesn't even agree on what has to be done. . . . I want them to 
do well, but I can't produce any credible evidence that they will." 
</P>
<P>
Pretty harsh criticism for a company whose sales have doubled since 1986 and 
whose very name is synonymous in high-tech circles for what Apple co-founder 
Steven Jobs called "insanely great" products and a bold view of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, responds Sculley, it's unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple is a company that gets measured on a different yardstick," says the 
intense 49-year-old chairman who joined Apple five years ago after being wooed 
away from the presidency of Pepsi Cola. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple is talked about as though it lives on the edge of reality. People expect 
it to have superhuman powers. But the fact is that we are mere mortals." 
</P>
<P>
And the mortals at Apple these days, explains Sculley, are interested in 
pursuing an evolutionary rather than revolutionary strategy. Translated into 
action, this means that Apple will continue to make incremental improvements to 
its existing Macintosh system, a line whose sales total nearly 3 million 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
In the marketing world, where Sculley blazed trails while at Pepsi in the 1960s 
and '70s, this approach is called "line extension": the creation of a family of 
vaguely similar products (i.e., cola, cherry cola, diet cola, caffeine-free 
cola) to appeal to the broadest audience. 
</P>
<P>
Transferred to the world of high tech, the approach has produced a series of 
improvements to the Macintosh, not one of which radically stands out, but which 
together have produced a broadly accepted personal computer, widely considered 
to be the easiest and most enjoyable to use of the machines available. 
</P>
<P>
Does it matter to Sculley that the basic Macintosh technology was developed in 
the early half of the 1980s by a team of engineers led by Jobs, who left Apple 
in 1985, and that his own leadership has produced nothing of the magnitude of 
Jobs' contribution? 
</P>
<P>
No, not really. Sculley says there's more to running a high-tech company than 
far-out technology and state-of-the-art wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
"People would like it if we could come up with something so revolutionary that 
they would gasp," he explains. "But then the Macintosh would be immediately 
obsolete. And we have had too much success with the Mac to do that. We have to 
do it with incremental innovations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wall Street Wary 
</P>
<P>
But incremental innovations might not be enough. Market researchers and Wall 
Street analysts say they are growing increasingly concerned that the key 
competitive edge the Macintosh has long enjoyed over its PC competitors -- 
namely its easy-to-use features -- is fast disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Presentation Manager, a software program developed by IBM and Microsoft for IBM 
personal computers offers users some of the same easily understood graphics 
features originally introduced on the Macintosh. As the product gains 
acceptance, many fear that the Macintosh technology will lose much of its 
luster. 
</P>
<P>
"People won't dump their Macs because of it," says Dyson, the newsletter 
publisher. "But if they want the latest system, they might go with IBM." 
</P>
<P>
Although Apple has introduced two pieces of technology that enhance the 
capabilities of the Macintosh -- including an indexing system called HyperCard 
and the Hyper TV video system -- neither has a proven appeal for the general 
office user, the person for whom the vast majority of computer purchases are 
made. And neither is considered sufficiently exciting to prop up the value of 
the Mac's graphic features. 
</P>
<P>
But even more disturbing, Dyson says, is her sense that Apple executives don't 
seem concerned by the looming competition. "It's hard to tell whether they have 
even recognized this threat," she says. "I get conflicting senses of direction 
from the top managers." 
</P>
<P>
Apple's top executives, installed during two thorough corporate reorganizations 
in the past few years, are also a concern to other outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly have some doubts," says Bruce Lupatkin, a high-technology analyst 
for Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco brokerage. "I'd like to see the 
results of all the reorganizations and product development work . . . . I want 
to know if all the right people are in the right management slots now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chip Shortage Blamed 
</P>
<P>
Lupatkin says his growing concerns about the company prompted him to stop 
recommending the stock to clients about a month ago. Apple stock has been 
hovering in recent weeks in the mid- to high-$30s, down from a 52-week high of 
$47.75 late last year. 
</P>
<P>
He is particularly concerned about the company's announcement last month that 
earnings for its quarter ending March 30 could be as much as 42% lower than 
they were a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company blames the projected decline on its peak-price purchase last summer 
of shortage-plagued memory chips and a subsequent decision -- since reversed -- 
to increase Macintosh prices to cover the higher chip prices. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, at least three other investment houses issued negative comments 
about Apple. Montgomery Securities, lowered its rating of the stock to 
"neutral"; Prudential-Bache cut its earnings estimate for the company, and a 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst was quoting as saying he is concerned that 
the company is losing some of its competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
The investment analysts' comments came in response to Apple's decision last 
week to offer rebates to spur sales of its products. The annoucement was viewed 
as yet more evidence that the company's profits will be squeezed this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lupatkin and others question whether top management -- particularly Sculley, 
who was on a much publicized sabbatical last summer -- was paying sufficient 
attention to operating details. "I think there was a breakdown, no matter what 
the company insists," Lupatkin says. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Sculley says there was little he or anyone at the company could 
have done, given the tight market for dynamic random access memory chips last 
year. Now, he says, the company is back on course. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not necessarily any reason to cheer, says Stewart Alsop II, 
publisher of a personal computer newsletter. Alsop has repeatedly criticized 
Apple's product development efforts and singles out the company's long-delayed 
introduction of a Macintosh laptop model, now scheduled for unveiling later 
this year, as an example of the company's product problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no basic leadership in product design," he says. "Is it legitimate to 
have a product like the laptop under development for two years, when the 
world's basic understanding of computer technology changes every nine to 18 
months? They should cancel the product right now and start over. It won't be 
the right product when it comes out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diamond Earring 
</P>
<P>
Others question whether Apple has even fully exploited the potential of the 
Macintosh. For example, one analyst notes that HyperCard, a unique and 
sophisticated indexing system, is ideal for database management requirements of 
businesses. But the company, he claims, may be losing that market to inferior 
systems because it has failed to move quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
Often singled out for criticism is Jean-Louis Gassee, president of Apple 
Products and the man ultimately responsible for new product development. 
Critics sneer that Gassee, the former head of Apple's marketing effort in 
France, has gotten as far as he has because he rhapsodizes philosophical with a 
French accent and wears a single diamond earring. 
</P>
<P>
"He runs around talking philosophical, but basically his job is to provide 
products that people want to buy," says one critic who asks to remain 
anonymous. "But in 3 1/2 years on the job, he's introduced four products." 
</P>
<P>
Sculley, who has blamed the laptop delay on inadequate technology for the 
screen resolution, fiercely defends Gassee and his product introductions. He 
says more than 50% of Apple's revenue has come from new products during 
Gassee's tenure at the helm of the product research operation, an achievement 
he calls "an extraordinary record of success." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sculley admits that Gassee has his critics. "He loves to be very 
French; he loves to bathe his language in a thick French accent. He's 
controversial, but he's exciting." 
</P>
<P>
If that excitement can be translated into a steady stream of innovative 
products that ultimately creates the "Knowledge Navigator" -- or something 
close to it -- is still another question. 
</P>
<P>
And there'll be no quick answer. According to Chris Espinosa, who joined Apple 
at age 15 when it was housed in Jobs' garage, new product development in some 
ways have become a victim of Apple's success. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we're in mainstream businesses and offices, people are having to use 
our technology because that is what the company has purchased. They're not 
necessarily choosing to use us like they did before. It means we can't get away 
with as much as we did before when just our devotees bought Macs," says the 
27-year-old Espinosa. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Espinosa says a fire has been lit under the advanced technology 
engineers. Sculley's "Knowledge Navigator" video, he claims, was designed more 
to inspire engineers within Apple than outside audiences. One result, he notes, 
is that the advanced technology group is organizing around integrated computer 
concepts, rather than around specialized technologies, such as video and audio 
that must be married at a later point. 
</P>
<P>
And he says the focus goes far beyond the Mac. "We're looking at how this 
technology can be used in totally new ways," he says. "This is the first time 
that we've done this across the large organization." 
</P>
<P>
The task may not be an easy, or quick, one. Explains Randy Battat, vice 
president of product marketing, "We're taking the Holy War to the next 
frontier." 
</P>
