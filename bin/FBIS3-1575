  [Text] Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping and using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole 
party is a fundamental task put forth by the 14th CPC National 
Congress for strengthening party building during the new period. 
For this reason, it is necessary for us to theoretically 
clarify relations between Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to 
increase our understanding, dispel misgivings, enhance our 
consciousness, and sharpening our sense of urgency for 
strengthening our study, so that we can grasp in a still better 
way the origin and essence of the theory. 
  1. Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is the latest product of the integration 
of Marxism and the practical reality in China. It is an 
inheritance of Mao Zedong Thought under the new historical 
conditions, and Marxism in contemporary China. 
  Our party is a vanguard of the working class, which takes 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding thought. In 
the past, now, and in the future, we unswervingly regard 
Marxism- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding thought of 
the whole party. However, in the course of historical 
development, and in different historical stages, Marxism -- as a 
unified ideological system -- has different theoretical 
manifestations. The integration of Marxism with the reality in 
Russia gave rise to Leninism. The integration of Marxism with 
the reality in China gave rise to Mao Zedong Thought. The 
continuation of the development of Mao Zedong Thought has 
inevitably given rise to a new theoretical summation. This is 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. This does not mean that the latter negates the 
former, or that they are completely the same. This can only 
mean that the latter inherits and develops the former, so that 
Marxism, as a comprehensive ideological system, can constantly 
enrich and improve itself, and is full of vigor and vitality 
with the development of practice. 
  Proletarian revolutionary teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and 
Mao Zedong successfully expounded and solved the problem of how 
the proletariat must seize state power. Due to restrictions of 
historical conditions, the problem of building socialism, and, 
in particular, the problem of how to consolidate and develop 
socialism in countries which are economically and culturally 
backward, has not yet been solved well. 
  Chinese communists of the new generation, represented by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, have shouldered this important historical 
task. They respect practice, the masses, and their pioneering 
spirit. They have scientifically summed up the experience and 
creativity of the masses. They have inherited the experiences 
of their predecessors, broken with outmoded conventions, and led 
us to successfully carry out reform, opening up, and 
modernization. In the process of making great achievements, 
they have gradually formed and established their socialist 
theories with Chinese characteristics. For the first time they 
have systematically and initially answered a series of basic 
questions, including the road of socialist development, stages 
of development, fundamental tasks, motives for development, 
leading force, the force which must be relied upon, external 
conditions for building socialism, political guarantees, 
strategic steps, unification of the motherland, and so on. They 
have pointed out the way to carry out socialist construction, 
consolidate and develop the basic principle of developing 
socialism, and the way forward. They have inherited and 
developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. 
  2. It is imperative to correctly comprehend how Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism inherits and develops 
Mao Zedong Thought, and corrects Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes 
committed during his remaining years to enhance our 
consciousness in implementing the party's basic line. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Since the Third Plenary 
Session, we have restored those correct things of Comrade Mao 
Zedong. In other words, we have accurately and comprehensively 
applied Mao Zedong Thought. This still remains our basic point. 
Now we are doing things which Comrade Mao Zedong raised, but 
had not completed. We should advocate matters which he wrongly 
opposed, and do things which he failed to accomplish. For a 
fairly long period of time in the future, we must still do these 
things well. Of course, we must develop, and continue to 
develop them." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks have actually 
revealed the three relations between the inheritance and 
development of Mao Zedong Thought by the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the correction of 
the mistakes committed by Mao Zedong during his remaining years. 
  Let us first talk about inheritance. Inheritance means 
receiving a valuable legacy from predecessors. Inheriting and 
receiving can be traced to the same origin. For example, 
seeking truth from facts is our party's ideological line. Both 
Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Deng Xiaoping actively advocate 
this line. This is a main line linking Mao Zedong Thought and 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I believe in 
seeking truth from facts advocated by Chairman Mao. In the 
past, we relied on it to fight the war. Now we must also rely 
on it to carry out construction and reform." He added: 
"Seeking truth from facts is the essence of Marxism. We must 
advocate this, but not book worship." Let's look at another 
example. The mass line is our party's basic working line. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping leads the whole party to inherit and 
persist in pursuing this line which Comrade Mao Zedong advocated 
and followed. In the meantime, he arouses the enthusiasm and 
creativity of the broad masses of people through reform and 
opening up. This has enabled our country to considerably 
develop productive forces, and greatly improved the living 
standard of the people. Attaining the target of common 
prosperity is no longer an invisible dream. It is precisely 
because Comrade Deng Xiaoping inherited from Comrade Mao Zedong 
the fine tradition and work style of the mass line -- and that 
he is good at applying a good method of summing up the 
experiences of the masses and refining, processing, and 
developing them into theories -- that the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is close to life and is 
welcomed and accepted by the masses, just as Mao Zedong Thought 
was. There is one more example. Independence and initiative is 
our party's basic principle for developing itself and handling 
external relations. It is an important component of Mao Zedong 
Thought. It is also a spiritual fulcrum and theoretical 
prerequisite for the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics created by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and has 
enabled China to take a road of development different from those 
taken by other socialist countries. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
repeatedly told the whole party: "Combining the universal truth 
of Marxism with the practical reality in China, taking our own 
road, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a 
basic conclusion drawn from our long-term historical 
experiences." 
  In addition, Mao Zedong Thought also includes rich contents 
of upholding the socialist road, the people's democratic 
dictatorship, the communist party leadership, and 
Marxism-Leninism. With regard to the issue of the four upholds, 
Comrade Mao Zedong's firm conviction and systematic guidance 
educated the Chinese communists of the entire generation well. 
It is Comrade Deng Xiaoping who has inherited this spiritual 
legacy well, and constantly injected contents of the new era 
into it, and carried it forward. 
  Thus it can be seen that Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics has fully inherited the 
living soul of Mao Zedong Thought. Without such an inheritance, 
the party history will be cut off, or even negated. We will 
thus lose our basic foothold, and get lost. 
  As far as development is concerned, it means opening up and 
blazing new trails. It also means that in front of the new 
situation, we study the new issues, sum up new experiences, 
generalize new viewpoints, and establish new theories. This 
shows that Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics tops Mao Zedong Thought. Since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our 
country has entered a new historical period, and great changes 
have taken place in both the domestic and international 
situation. The new situation and practice has provided us with 
unprecedentedly favorable conditions and new experiences. This 
has laid a firm and practical foundation for the development of 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and the new theory as well. 
For instance, with the deepening of reform, our party has put 
forth a series of relevant new viewpoints and theories. They 
mainly include: The full development of the commodity economy 
is an insuperable stage of the development of the social 
economy; the planned economy is not tantamount to socialism, and 
the market economy is not tantamount to capitalism; socialism 
can also pursue the market economy, and the aim of our country's 
economic structural reform is to establish a socialist market 
economic system, and so on. In the development of Marxist 
theory, they have theoretically solved, for the first time, the 
issue of combining commodity economy with market economy and 
socialism so that we can make a major breakthrough in 
understanding relations between planning and market. This has 
brought about unprecedented and fundamental changes in the 
socialist economic pattern. Revolution means emancipation of 
productive forces, and so does reform. Reform is also a 
profound revolution, and the only way for emancipating and 
developing productive forces under the socialist conditions. In 
the history of the development of Marxism, they have, for the 
first time, correctly pointed out the driving force for the 
development of socialism. This negates the theory which has 
always taken class struggle as a driving force for the 
development of socialism. This has enabled us to find a road 
for rapidly developing socialism and making our country powerful 
and strong. The essence of socialism is the emancipation and 
development of productive forces, elimination of exploitation 
and polarization, and eventual attainment of common prosperity. 
This is a major supplement and correction of the previous 
standards on socialism. 
  Lastly, let us talk about correction. Correction means 
correcting a few inferences wrongly drawn by Comrade Mao Zedong 
during his later years due to historical conditions, and which 
have been proved by practice that they no longer conform with 
the demand of the new era. It means amending, supplementing, 
and improving certain viewpoints which can no longer conform 
with the new situation due to changes of conditions. This shows 
that the latecomer (Deng's theory) is highly responsible for the 
old timer (Mao Thought), the masses, and history. For example, 
with regard to the issue of concentrating our efforts on 
developing productive forces, Comrade Mao Zedong realized this, 
because it is a common knowledge of Marxism. This was also a 
problem which he strived to solve all his life. However, owing 
to the fact that he made a wrong estimation of the class 
situation in our country and the political situation of the 
party and state, he adopted a wrong method to deal with it. In 
this connection, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly told the 
whole party that we must concentrate our efforts on developing 
productive forces, and treat this as the most fundamental task 
of the entire party. 
  In a word, Deng Xiaoping theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristic has inherited the living soul of Mao 
Zedong Thought and developed Mao Zedong Thought and has, through 
practice, found the road of reform and opening up for the 
Chinese people with an aim of making their country powerful and 
strong. The nucleus of the theory is "one center, two basic 
points," and its nature and essence are emancipating the mind, 
seeking truth from facts, and everything proceeding from 
reality. The nucleus of the theory is our political line, and 
the party's unshakable basic line in the entire initial period 
of socialism. The essence of the theory is our cognitive line, 
and an ideological line which our party must stick to under all 
circumstances. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, let 
us strive for a new victory in reform, opening up, and 
modernization!
