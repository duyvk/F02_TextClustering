THE NEW YEAR PROMISES TREMENDOUS PROGRESS, FRUSTRATING SETBACKS AND DAUNTING 
CHALLENGES FOR ORANGE COUNTY. THERE IS TRANSPORTATION MONEY APLENTY, BUT SOCIAL 
SERVICE AGENCIES COULD GO BEGGING. STRIDES ARE EXPECTED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
FRONT, BUT EDUCATORS WILL HAVE TO DO MORE WITH LESS AND FIGHT FOR EVERY DOLLAR 
FROM THE STATE.;

While transportation picks up steam, environmentalists hope to maintain 
momentum gained from 1990, the year of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Progress will be made in the continuing effort to clean up the county's 
polluted but valuable ground-water basin. The Orange County Water District will 
open five state-of-the-art treatment plants in 1991 to remove chemicals from 
the water basin and produce about 8 million gallons a day of drinkable water. 
Most of the contamination came from old agricultural runoff or industrial 
solvent spills. 
</P>
<P>
The year should also bring long-awaited regulations that would require sewage 
plants and dairy farms that discharge into the Santa Ana River to build 
treatment plants. The river is a main source of the county's ground water.

Any business leaders who are dumping toxic waste illegally may find 1991 a good 
year to straighten up. The district attorney's office is mounting a crackdown 
on the crime, which has been increasing because of the cost and difficulty that 
Southern California companies face when disposing of waste legally. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen more Orange County cities will jump on the recycling bandwagon 
next year and implement programs that encourage residents to sort their 
bottles, papers and cans. 
</P>
<P>
"Residential recycling of some sort will be going on in almost every city next 
year," said Jan Goss, Orange County's recycling manager. "A lot of cities have 
programs in planning stages now and will be implementing them soon." 
</P>
<P>
Local conservationists anticipate some fierce battles in 1991 as they try to 
protect the oak groves, coastal sage scrub and other rapidly vanishing wildlife 
habitats in Gypsum Canyon, Coal Canyon and the southeastern canyons of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
They promise to fight some new developments more vocally and actively than 
ever, saying they will resort to lawsuits if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County's not a lost cause yet," said Esther Burkett, the state 
Department of Fish and Game's wildlife biologist for Orange County. "But we 
have to slow down (development) right now. If we pursue this pace for the next 
10 years, then it is a lost cause." MARLA CONE
