THE GOVERNMENT is to provide nearly Pounds 500,000 to British trade
associations to help companies improve their competitiveness.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced yesterday that
13 associations had won a government competition aimed at helping them to
establish 'benchmarking clubs'. The clubs are intended to enable companies
to compare their business methods across a range of activities to identify
best practice.
Benchmarking clubs are used extensively in the US to promote
competitiveness. In a bid to encourage the development of similar clubs, Mr
Heseltine offered up to Pounds 50,000 to each winner.
The government received entries from 38 trade bodies representing more than
55,000 companies. The schemes had to identify areas, such as production
efficiency, product quality or customer relations, that they wished to
improve. The department said companies should be actively involved in the
formation and development of the clubs.
An important measure was the value the schemes would add to business
performance in the view of the customer.
The winners were: British Footwear Manufacturers Federation; British
Clothing Industry Association; British Constructional Steelwork Association;
British Iron & Steel Producers Association; Fenestration Benchmarking Club
(seven trade bodies in window production); General Aviation Manufacturers
and Traders Association; Metal Finishing Association; Confederation of
Suppliers to the Printing, Publishing, Pulp, Paper-making and Converting
Industry; Semiconductor Businesses Association; Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders; Society of British Aerospace Companies; UK Spring
Manufacturers Association.
