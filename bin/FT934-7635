ITALY was last night resisting attempts to reach an overall agreement on the
restructuring of the European Union's state-owned steel producers.
Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, rejected a compromise on
subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker, put
forward by the European Commission at a meeting of EU industry ministers in
Brussels.
The Commission has asked ministers to give their political blessing to
Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to six companies - in Italy, east
Germany, Spain and Portugal - in exchange for a total of 5.5m tonnes of
capacity cuts. Final agreement on the subsidy plans must be unanimous.
Political accord would provide the central plank of a wide-ranging EU
programme to support the ailing west European steel industry, which is
suffering from recession and over-capacity.
In the absence of a deal, private EU steelmakers made clear yesterday they
were not prepared to produce their own proposals to reduce capacity by a
further 10.5m tonnes. They are afraid that state-owned steelmakers will
continue to distort the depressed market with subsidised steel. Mr Savona
denied Italy was being inflexible. He said there was 'still a little margin
to strike a deal'.
Workers at the Italian state-owned steel works in Taranto, Europe's largest,
yesterday staged a short strike to highlight the threat to jobs posed by the
proposed capacity cuts.
German and Commission officials said yesterday they were pessimistic about
the chances of breaking Italy's veto. Instead, they said they hoped the 11
other EU industry ministers would agree separately on state aid for the
Spanish, east German and Portuguese state-owned steel industries, putting
more pressure on the Italians. However, other national officials cast doubt
on the possibility of even a partial agreement.
A loose coalition of Britain, Denmark, Luxembourg and France was still
opposed yesterday to elements of the east German and Spanish plans. Mr Tim
Sainsbury, British industry minister, said that 'no agreement would be
better than a bad agreement'.
Meanwhile, the Treuhand privatisation agency, which is handling the sale of
Ekostahl, the east German steel producer, will today set a deadline of
Tuesday for Riva, the Italian steelmaker, to provide more information on
prospects for a new hot rolling mill, including potential profitability.
