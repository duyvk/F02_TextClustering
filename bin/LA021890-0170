<P>
For the last two years, Los Angeles city officials have been designing what 
recycling experts say will be the largest and most sophisticated curbside 
trash-recycling plan in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Specially designed trucks, bins and cans will enable the city's sanitation 
crews to pick up, separate and haul hundreds of tons of recyclable trash daily 
from more than 720,000 households. The state-mandated recycling plan for Los 
Angeles is designed to cut in half the amount of garbage sent to rapidly 
filling city landfills. 
</P>
<P>
But now, as officials look toward a September kickoff date, there is just one 
hurdle left to jump: what to do with all the recyclable material once it is 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Los Angeles directing half its daily 4,000 tons of household 
trash into the recycling market during the next two years has many recycling 
officials concerned that there may not be enough demand. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds more California communities will inaugurate similar programs under 
recently signed state legislation requiring them to reduce their trash stream 
by 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The law has caused city and state officials to scramble for ways to promote the 
use of recyclable materials before this wave of reusable trash hits the 
long-established, but often fragile, markets for used newspapers, glass 
bottles, plastic jugs and tin cans. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, these officials are considering legislation that would 
force government to buy more recycled material for its own use, provide tax 
credits to companies that use or process such materials, and subsidize 
recycling companies through grants, loans and even free land. 
</P>
<P>
The need to build markets for recycled materials was underscored by the recent 
experience of cities and states on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Markets there collapsed when a huge stream of recyclable material came on the 
market last year after state laws in New Jersey and New York required cities to 
begin recycling programs. Some municipal officials there report that they were 
able to sell their used newsprint for $45 a ton last year, but now must pay $18 
a ton just to have it hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., officials are stockpiling newsprint collected for 
recycling because they cannot find buyers at any price. Prices of most other 
recyclables, although still marketable, have tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast officials have good reason to fear that such worst-case scenarios 
could be played out here. In recent weeks, some California recyclers have taken 
their glass to landfills because, they said, supply has overwhelmed demand. 
Because California's recycled-paper market is so limited, a number of cities 
have looked to the Far East to handle their paper. A Los Angeles plan to sell 
city-generated paper to China fell through last year, and organizers blamed 
political upheaval there. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic industry is constantly searching for new ways to use recycled 
material. Everything from police billy clubs to ski jackets contain recycled 
plastic. Recycling turns old bottles and cans into new bottles and cans. Egg 
crates, speed bumps and commercial "animal bedding" also are manufactured with 
reused household trash. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide push for recycling programs is driven by concerns about 
environmental pollution and the increasing scarcity of landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in California, officials fear that landfill rates will rise from 
$15-$20 a ton to $50 a ton. On Long Island, N.Y., landfill costs already exceed 
$100 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
"The future cost of landfilling is astronomical," said Joan Edwards, director 
of Los Angeles' recycling program. "Whatever the estimates are, triple them and 
they still won't come close." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who helped create a household-recycling program in New York City 
before taking her Los Angeles post in November, said it is necessary to build a 
consistent supply of recyclables before attempting to develop new markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to get government commitment (to recycling) is to lock them into 
a collection system they can't walk away from," Edwards said. "Who better than 
municipalities to subsidize the market in the short haul?" 
</P>
<P>
But now, with the state-required program, the day has arrived when market 
development must begin, according to Edwards and industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent a lot of time on collection efforts," said Lee Wiegandt, president 
of the California Glass Recycling Corp., an industry trade group. "If we don't 
start paying attention to the end-use market now, we'll pay the piper later." 
</P>
<P>
When fully implemented over a two-year period, the Los Angeles program will 
dwarf all other existing recycling programs in the state, industry officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The city's pilot program involves about 92,000 households, making it already 
one of the largest efforts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials have projected that the citywide effort will produce 
about 90,000 tons of glass to be recycled. That would represent a 26% increase 
in the total for the entire state in 1989, when 350,000 tons were collected, 
Wiegandt said. "It's frightening," he said of the projected increase. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' recycling program would generate about 100,000 tons of newspapers 
annually, according to city projections. That represents about a 35% increase 
in the total annual newspaper exports from the Port of Long Beach, the largest 
single port for used newsprint in the world, according to industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
These projections are causing officials in smaller cities to wonder where Los 
Angeles will market its recyclables. "It's going to be such a deluge on the 
market," said Joy Hamilton, administrative officer for the Burbank Public Works 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, about 20 communities have curbside recycling programs. 
Money raised through sale of the recyclable material usually offsets the 
increased costs of the program, and in some cities, such as Santa Monica, it 
turns a net profit. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles planners have projected that the recycling program will cost about 
$46 million a year for the first five years, with an estimated $13 million a 
year raised through the sale of recyclable material and reduced landfill costs. 
The remainder will be raised through city taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be scary for small towns, that L.A. will lock up the market," Edwards 
said. She said that some recycling companies may ask themselves, "Why deal with 
20 small towns, when you can deal with one big city?" 
</P>
<P>
But Edwards said her intention is not to carve up the market to suit the city 
of Los Angeles. "The health of the market depends on all of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City and industry officials hope that state and federal legislation will help 
create and support markets. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to have to be some supporting legislation," said Brian Austin, 
recycling coordinator for the city of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking to these bills (legislation) to pick up the slack in demand," 
said Jon Root, marketing specialist for the Santa Monica recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, the state of California, Los Angeles County, the city 
of Los Angeles and many other municipalities already have a host of laws and 
administrative guidelines designed to encourage the use of products with some 
recycled content. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies are encouraged to use a wide variety of recycled material, 
including paper, motor oil and paving materials, said John Arlington, chief 
counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee, 
which recently held 10 hearings on recycling markets. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are so many waivers and outs that it's really just a suggestion that 
they use recycled products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other laws require certain industries to begin reusing some of their own 
products. Newspaper publishers, for instance, are required under California law 
to use newsprint with a 50% recycled content in at least 25% of their product 
by 1994. (The Times far exceeds those requirements. Currently, 80% of its 
newsprint consists of 50% recycled paper.) 
</P>
<P>
New York state has formed an office of recycling markets development, with a 
$5.5-million budget for grants and low-cost loans to companies seeking to test 
new recycled products and processes. 
</P>
<P>
Without taking markets into consideration, some government collection programs 
have run into problems. For example, recyclers and glass manufacturers say the 
California returnable bottle law is the cause of recent upheaval in the West 
Coast glass market. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "2020" program -- known by its state Assembly bill number -- set 
minimum prices for glass, aluminum and plastic containers to make it economical 
for companies to operate collection centers. But manufacturers say the price 
for recycled glass, $94 a ton, is much higher than the $60 a ton they would pay 
for the equivalent raw material. 
</P>
<P>
Wiegandt of the glass manufacturers' trade group said, "Any time you set an 
artificial price, you are going to run into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Recyclers say that the manufacturers have been refusing to accept delivery of 
recyclable glass, citing color contamination from mixing clear, green and brown 
bottles. But recyclers say the real reason is that the manufacturers do not 
want to pay the high price required under the law. State legislation requires 
glass manufacturers to repurchase some of their product through recycling 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Glassmakers deny they are rejecting more loads. A spokesman for Owens Brockway 
Corp., one of the largest glass manufacturers in the state, said the company 
rejects less than 4% of all loads and rejected less in 1989 than the prior 
year. Industry figures show that total usage of recycled glass is up. 
</P>
<P>
Coy Smith of San Diego Recyclers said he dumped 40 tons of glass in a landfill 
last month after having it rejected by glassmakers and lacking any other viable 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Smith said, low-quality, mixed-color glass would be salable to 
fiberglass makers. But in-state fiberglass companies have abandoned the market 
since the minimum state prices were imposed last year, according to Wiegandt 
and others in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Developing new markets and local recycling facilities often face obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Community Recycling &amp; Resource Recovery, a Sun Valley recycler, developed a 
method of processing used newsprint into a paper pulp substitute. In an effort 
to make the product more economical to ship and broaden its market, the company 
sought to build a drying plant to reduce water content in the material, 
according to Michael O'Reily, a consultant to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
But the Air Quality Management District vetoed the idea because of its high 
energy use and resulting pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The wait for new processing plants envisioned by recycling officials could be a 
long one. 
</P>
<P>
Rand Burgner, deputy executive director of the North Hempstead, N.Y., Solid 
Waste Management Authority, said there was similar talk back East, but "I don't 
see anyone breaking ground. There's a hell of a lot of talk about new plants, 
but to build (processing facilities requires) a long, arduous and expensive 
environmental impact report procedure to get permission for construction. It's 
years away. It's going to get worse before it gets better."
