J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland ("J.K.") (Registered Importer No. R-90-006) has petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 that was manufactured for importation
into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
The petitioner stated that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified version of the 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 to its
U.S. certified counterpart, and found that the two vehicles are substantially similar with respect to compliance
with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1970 Ferrari 365
GT 2+2, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as
its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 is identical to its U.S. certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102
