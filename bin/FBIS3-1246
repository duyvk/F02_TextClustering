<H5>  "Black Economic Empowerment" </H5>
  The fashionable definition of `black economic empowerment' 
is 
the placing of black people in high profile managerial 
positions. More recently, this has been expanded to include the 
acquisition by a few individuals of equity in companies 
previously owned exclusively by whites. In the not too distant 
future, some will further extend this definition to include a 
black elite whose access to political office will, it is 
presumed give them access to the state coffers. 
  Of course, if we accept this definition, we would play 
directly into the syndrome of `white faces, black masks'. That 
is, the economy continues to be owned and controlled by a small 
minority, while the majority remain trapped in squalor and 
poverty. A few blacks, and a few women, are co-opted into what 
was previously a white boy's club. The rules of the game, 
however, remain fundamentally the same. 
  This is not empowerment, but black economic disempowerment. 
It leaves the lives of the majority of people unchanged. It is 
the story of the majority of post-colonial societies, inside and 
outside Africa--a story of broken promises, compradorism, 
corrupt elites, and betrayal. It is a story which COSATU 
[Congress of South African Trade Unions] and the working people 
are determined will not be repeated in our country. 
  The debate about black economic empowerment and affirmative 
action has until recently largely been confined to the 
boardrooms. For the majority, these discussions have been 
remote. At best, they have been seen as attempts by a system in 
crisis to defend itself by selectively co-opting blacks into 
token positions. At worst, the black economic empowerment 
debate has been seen as irrelevant to changing the lives of the 
majority of people. 
  This situation is now changing. We want to redefine the 
terms of the debate, so that it can be placed at the centre of 
our agenda for transformation. Black economic empowerment needs 
to be seen not as a cosmetic attempt to dress up old apartheid 
structures of power and privilege by co-opting selected 
individuals. Rather it should be viewed as a programme to 
genuinely empower millions of people who have previously been 
disempowered. 
  This new definition of black economic empowerment would 
involve at least four key objectives: 
  -  Empowering the majority who have been economically 
dispossessed to participate meaningfully in the mainstream of 
the economy at all levels; 
  -  Unleashing the previously stifled human potential of the 
majority in a way which benefits them and their communities; 
  -  Creating the infrastructure needed for viable economic 
activity, which is currently denied to vast areas of our country; 
  -  Involving people directly in decision-making which affects 
their lives. This means first and foremost empowering them in 
the area of economic decision-making. 
    The democratic movement's Programme of Reconstruction and 
Development [RDP] is precisely designed to achieve these 
objectives. The RDP should therefore be seen as a programme of 
economic empowerment. As I unpack this new definition of black 
economic empowerment, I will try to show how the RDP intends to 
go about achieving these objectives. 
<H5>  Affirmative Action </H5>
  Affirmative action in the workplace is a means of redressing 
past discrimination and disadvantage which has denied black, 
women, rural and disabled people equality of employment 
opportunity. There are two main elements to affirmative action: 
to eliminate discrimination, whether blatant or subtle; to 
implement positive measures to eliminate past disadvantage. 
  Affirmative action for us, therefore goes much deeper than 
just putting a few black faces into supervisory and management 
positions. 
  Chapter Four of the Reconstruction and Development Programme 
outlines areas where affirmative action is needed. It argues 
that to be effective, affirmative action measures would have to 
contain at least the following seven elements: 
  1. A massive programme of education, training, retraining, 
adult basic education and recognition of prior learning, to 
overcome the legacy of apartheid; 
  2. Empower not only individuals, but communities and groups, 
under conditions which promote the collective rights and 
capacity of workers and their representatives to negotiate 
workplace issues; 
  3. Establish principles for the hiring and promotion of 
workers which will prevent discrimination against people 
previously disadvantaged by apartheid; 
  4. Accelerate, through collective bargaining programmes, the 
eradication of discrimination in each and every workplace; 
  5. Provide job security for pregnant women and promote the 
provision of child care, to further women's equality in 
employment; 
  6. Ensure that the development of special expertise among 
South Africans takes priority over the import of outside 
personnel; and 
  7. Establish legislation and a strong ombuds to monitor and 
implement affirmative action measures. 
  The last point notwithstanding, we do not believe that 
legislation or quotas should be the main mechanisms for 
achieving affirmative action. Social and workplace programmes 
negotiated directly with workers must be at the heart of any 
affirmative action drive. 
  At the level of the workplace this means negotiations need 
to 
take place between management and unions on a process of 
affirmative action. This should result in the setting up of 
joint affirmative action committees, with equal representation. 
Management would need to give full commitment to the 
implementation of a programme. Resources would need to be made 
available, including for training, research on the problems to 
be addressed, and full disclosure of information. 
  The committee would need to identify areas which need 
attention. These could include; recruitment procedures and 
procedures for promotion; working conditions; training, 
education, and career paths; disciplinary procedures; 
retrenchment and retirement; wage differentials and benefits; 
facilities; and codes of conduct. 
  Having identified the problem areas, the union and 
management 
should negotiate a plan to address them. The plan should 
include both `negative' and `positive' elements: removing all 
barriers to equality, and formulating measures to ensure that 
the whole company employment structure becomes broadly 
representative of the composition of South African society. 
Genuine affirmative action programmes should also aim to go 
beyond the company gates, into the communities. 
  It is not enough to have an impressive-looking programme 
with noble statements of intent. The plan should contain clear 
time frames and targets, as well as mechanisms to ensure joint 
monitoring and evaluation. If the company's target is to ensure 
that artisans reflect the composition of South African society 
by 1998, there must be a clear programme which sets out how this 
target will be achieved. 
  This is not to suggest that the negotiation of affirmative 
action programmes should be limited to the workplace. National 
measures are necessary in relation to education and training, 
for example, which would have to be implemented both at industry 
level, and by the state. 
  The democratic state will play a key role in implementing an 
affirmative action programme. Public sector employment 
practices should set an example for the private sector. In 
addition to the process of affirmative action negotiations 
outlined above, government should introduce measures to ensure 
that government departments and parastatals reach their targets. 
Importantly, this needs to include reduction of differentials 
between low-paid and high-paid workers. Funding of departments 
could be made contingent on submission of acceptable plans. 
  The democratic government should also take steps to use its 
influence over the private sector to promote affirmative action. 
These could include: procurement policies which specify that 
any publically funded programme, or commissioning of goods and 
services by the state, will be conditional on the relevant 
company having made satisfactory progress in implementing an 
affirmative action programme; any state funding or subsidies to 
private institutions would similarly be contingent on progress 
in this area. Further particular priority could be given in 
allocating state funding to programmes which play an important 
role in advancing the process of affirmative action, eg adult 
basic education. 
  The state would need to ensure a massive expansion of the 
country's labour market statistical base. This is necessary to 
monitor the degree of progress being made in different areas in 
implementing the programme. 
  Finally, I want to deal with irresponsible statements made 
by 
the NP [National Party] and some employers that affirmative 
action aims to replace whites, coloureds and Indians with 
African workers. Affirmative action is part of our 
reconstruction programme which aims to ensure that all our human 
resources are properly developed, and that mass unemployment is 
not regarded as something acceptable, regardless of which sector 
of our society is affected. 
  Affirmative action is aimed at uplifting all those 
communities which have been historically disadvantaged by 
apartheid. Coloured and Indian communities would therefore be 
major beneficiaries of affirmative action programmes. 
  Affirmative action is not designed to punish any particular 
group. White workers are already becoming victims of the 
economic devastation caused by apartheid. The unleashing of the 
countries productive potential, and the resultant economic 
growth and job creation which will flow from bringing previously 
disadvantaged workers into the mainstream of the economy, will 
ultimately benefit all workers, including white workers. COSATU 
rejects any attempt to abuse affirmative action to create racial 
divisions between workers. Mere replacement of white individuals 
with blacks is tokenism which distorts the whole purpose of 
affirmative action. 
<H5>  Workplace Democratisation </H5>
  The South African economy is in a typical third world cul de 
sac--cheap labour, low skill, low technology, overreliance on 
primary commodities. Employers have to come to terms with the 
fact that to get out of this trap we have to end the culture of 
unilateral management decision-making. Industrial 
democratisation is the only route available to South Africa 
which will unleash the creative and productive potential of our 
people. 
  Meaningful empowerment of workers goes way beyond the 
so-called 'worker participation' schemes which are springing up 
in our industries. Most of these schemes, such as quality 
circles, just-in-time etc, are devised to involve workers in 
reorganising work, in a bid to raise levels of productivity and 
profitability. They do not empower workers to make decisions on 
fundamental issues affecting their lives. Further, these 
schemes concentrate on the micro-issues, and do not involve 
workers in decisions on the broad strategic direction of the 
whole company or industry. 
  There is a need for a radical rethink on the process of 
industrial democratisation, to ensure meaningful economic 
empowerment of the majority of workers. Management will have to 
accept that decisions on areas such as investment; technology; 
research and development; training; job creation; levels of 
renumeration; and even distribution of profits; can no longer be 
their sole preserve. Joint decision-making in these area will 
have to become a fact of economic life if our economy is to 
emerge from its current crisis. 
  The ANC [African National Congress] has committed itself to 
ensuring workplace empowerment. The RDP states that: 
"Legislation must facilitate worker participation and 
decision-making in the world of work. Such legislation must 
include an obligation on employers to negotiate substantial 
changes concerning production matters or workplace organisation 
within a nationally negotiated framework." 
  The RDP states further that "company and tax law must be 
amended to ensure that the rights of workers are protected and 
extended...in relation to workers access to company information". 
  This path of industrial democratisation is new for both 
management and unions. We will all have to climb a steep 
learning curve. 
<H5>  Black Ownership </H5>
  The issue of black economic empowerment and black ownership 
is often seen as depending on the acquisition by individual 
entrepreneurs of companies. Yet what is forgotten is that trade 
unions are the single biggest vehicle of empowerment for black 
people. As we confront the challenge of rebuilding the economy, 
we are determined to use our economic muscle to benefit our 
members and their communities. 
  Workers have invested billions of rand in pension and 
provident funds. Yet they have little say in how their money is 
invested. While they and their families cry out for investment 
in jobs, housing, infrastructure, and real development; pension 
funds continue to speculate on the stock exchange, and on glass 
buildings. COSATU is discussing ways of ensuring that real 
control of how their money is invested is put in the hands of 
workers. 
  The RDP states that "pension and provident funds should be 
made more accountable to their members.... The democratic 
government must change the law to ensure adequate representation 
for workers through the trade unions and...legislate a 
transformation of the boards of the mutual funds to make them 
more socially responsible." 
  Other forms of ownership by workers and unions have emerged 
and need to be developed further. These include the setting up 
of co-operatives and small businesses for retrenched workers. 
Another possibility which needs to be explored is of workers 
taking over their companies through buy-outs. There have been 
successful examples of workers taking over failing companies in 
countries such as the USA and Britain. These experiments have 
not yet been possible here, however. 
  Workers share ownership schemes which have been introduced 
by 
employers have, until now been tokenism of the worst kind. At 
best these have been meaningless charity. At worst they have 
been transparent attempts to diffuse union struggles for a 
living wage. Share ownership schemes could only be of any real 
benefit to workers if negotiated with them, and if accompanied 
by a meaningful measure of worker control. 
  Recently there have been a spate of takeovers, deals, and 
launches of new companies by black entrepreneurs. To the extent 
that this represents a challenge to the existing white 
monopolies, and a move in the direction of socially responsible 
business, COSATU would welcome these developments. Further, it 
represents a move away from the traditional image of black 
business being confined to taxis, bottle stores, and shebeens. 
  However, at least some of these deals have exhibited the 
same 
old syndrome of `white faces, black masks'. Black businessmen 
must be wary of being used by conglomerates to serve their own 
ends. A failure to distinguish between genuine empowerment, and 
fronting for white business, will continue to create a 
credibility problem for black business. 
  The Reconstruction and Development Programme identifies the 
existence of monopolies and conglomerates as the main obstacle 
of black business: "The domination of business activities by 
white business and the exclusion of black people from the 
mainstream of economic activity are causes for great concern.. 
A central objective of the RDP is to deracialise business 
ownership and control completely, through focussed policies of 
black economic empowerment.... The RDP will introduce strict 
anti-trust legislation to create a more competitive and dynamic 
business environment. The central objectives of such 
legislation are to systematically discourage the system of 
pyramids where they lead to over- concentration of economic 
power and interlocking directorships, to abolish numerous 
anti-competitive practices such as market domination and abuse, 
and to prevent the exploitation of consumers." 
  The opening up of the economy will also led to the flowering 
of small and medium enterprises (SME's). The building of 
infrastructure, the installation of electricity, and the 
increase in peoples purchasing power will create unprecedented 
opportunities for the setting up of SME's particularly in 
townships and rural areas. 
  The RDP emphasises that policies need to be put in place to 
develop the much-romanticised informal sector from `marginalised 
survival strategies into dynamic small enterprises that provide 
a decent leaving for both employees and entrepreneurs'. 
  The RDP identifies four major constraints facing small and 
micro enterprise (informal sector) including the lack of access 
to: credit, markets, skills and supportive institutional 
arrangements. A range of measures are proposed which the state 
can implement to address these problems. These include: 
Government agencies must provide infrastructure and...provide 
training in productive and managerial skills. The government 
must require financial institutions to lend a rising share of 
their assets to black-owned enterprise. All levels of the state 
should...support joint marketing strategies and technological 
development within the small-scale sector. Existing agencies 
such as SBDC [Small Business Development Corporation] and IDC 
[Industrial Development Corporation] should be restructured to 
support small business more effectively...and end corruption and 
nepotism in their lending programmes. Infrastructural programmes 
(such as building of roads, electricity) must take the 
implications for micro enterprise into account. Local government 
must review zoning and licensing regulations to end 
discrimination against micro and small enterprise. 
<H5>  Black Business and Social Responsibility </H5>
  COSATU will support these initiatives to empower all 
sections 
of our community to start businesses. The main proviso for this 
is that labour standards and the basic rights of workers mustn't 
be undermined. There is a danger, particularly in the context 
of the domination of our economy by monopolies, that emerging 
black business could seek to gain their competitive advantage 
through cheap labour and bad working conditions. 
  This is the path which emerging business has taken in some 
parts of the developing world. This parasitical form of 
capitalism is in fact encouraged by big business, which sees 
opportunities to lower its costs by closing down certain 
activities and sub-contracting to sweat shops, which they have a 
cosy relationship with. Such a trend is already beginning to 
emerge in South Africa, spearheaded by certain large 
corporations. This results in large-scale retrenchments and 
union bashing. COSATU wants to warn that this is a recipe for 
conflict. It won't work in our part of the world. The ANC has 
also rejected this path, committing itself in the RDP to protect 
workers rights and labour standards in SME's. 
  It is a myth, perpetuated by big business, that small 
business necessarily means sweat-shop style operations. The 
most successful SMEs and micro businesses, in terms of 
productivity, job creation, and technological development, are 
in fact in places like Italy, where flexibility is maintained 
without attacking labour standards. We need to study 
international experiences such as this, where industrial 
districts are developed to support SME's, and co- operation is 
sought with workers. 
  Black business, whether in SME's, or in larger enterprises, 
should be a pioneer of new relationships in the workplace. The 
forms of workplace democratisation and joint decision-making 
outlined above would place these businesses at an advantage, in 
terms of community support, levels of productivity, and 
technological development. The type of support mechanisms 
proposed by the RDP, together with healthy relationships with 
the trade unions, could enable black businesses to make this 
breakthrough. 
<H5>  Land and Rural Development </H5>
  Land is possibly the area where the black community has been 
most brutally disempowered by apartheid. It is therefore 
surprising that when people talk about black economic 
empowerment, the question of land reform is invariably left out. 
  According to the RDP "a national land reform programme is 
the 
central and driving force of rural development. Such a 
programme aims to address effectively the injustices of forced 
removals and the historical denial of access to land. It aims 
to ensure security of tenure for rural dwellers. And in 
implementing the national land reform programme, and through the 
provision of support services, the democratic government 
will...generate large-scale employment, increase rural incomes 
and eliminate overcrowding." 
  The land reform programme has two aspects: redistribution of 
residential and productive land to those who need it but cannot 
afford it, and restitution for those who lost land because of 
apartheid laws. The latter will be achieved by a land claims 
court, aimed at restoring land to those dispossessed since 1913. 
  The RDP outlines various ways in which land redistribution 
can be accomplished, aiming to redistribute 30 percent of 
agricultural land by 1999. This will be achieved by: 
strengthening property rights of communities already occupying 
land, combining market and non-market mechanisms to provide 
land, and using vacant government land. 
  Specific mechanisms proposed by the RDP to redistribute land 
include: 
  Acquiring land already on sale and land acquired by corrupt 
means from the apartheid state or mortgaged to state and 
parastatal bodies. 
  Substantial funding must be provided for land 
redistribution. 
A land tax on rural land must help to free up underutilised 
land, raise revenues for rural infrastructure, and promote the 
productive use of land. 
  Rural infrastructure, support services and training must be 
provided to ensure that land can be utilised effectively. 
  Rural development must also unsure that proper 
infrastructure 
is provided to rural areas, particularly the `homelands', where 
most rural people live, and have been denied access to the most 
basic infrastructure and social services. Small-scale farming, 
as well as small business needs to be supported. 
  The RDP proposes that "rural development policy must aim to 
co-ordinate the activities of the relevant democratic government 
agents, and to pass much of the control of democratic government 
funded services to the rural people for whom they are intended. 
The democratic government will include a central ministry of 
rural development and land reform. A unit for rural data 
collection and an early warning system for food and water 
security." 
<H5>  Empowerment of Black Women </H5>
  The legacy of apartheid, particularly the migrant labour and 
bantustan system, has meant that the majority of the poor in 
South Africa are black women. Measures aimed to address the 
disempowerment of women, and boost their role within the 
economy- particularly in relation to jobs, small business, land, 
and training are crucial if black women are not to be left on 
the margins of the economy. 
  We are proposing the following to empower black women: 
  Public works programmes must maximise the involvement of 
women and youth in the poorest rural households and most 
deprived regions to create assets such as water supply, 
sanitation and clinics. Institutions, practices and laws, 
including tenure and atrimonial laws, which discriminate 
against womens access to land must be reviewed to remove womens 
disabilities in relation to land. Adult basic education and 
training programmes should give special emphasis to equipping 
women to enter into the mainstream of economic life. These 
should have child-care facilities. 
  An accessible programme must be established to ensure 
government support for women entrepreneurs. It should include 
business training and access to credit the micro enterprise or 
informal sector requires special attention. 
  Local service centres and satellites must be increased to 
service women involved in enterprises. Women themselves need to 
be involved in planning and implementing these measures. Women 
must be involved in all the relevant institutions, councils 
and commissions. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  We have tried to show that black economic empowerment goes 
way beyond the creation of a black elite, or the enrichment of a 
few individuals. Affirmative action, workplace democratisation, 
worker ownership, black business, and land reform, if 
implemented properly, will bring about a revolution in the lives 
of millions of ordinary South Africans. 
  If we realise this vision, we can bring about an economic 
miracle parallel to what has happened in other parts of the 
world, without relying on social degradation and repression to 
achieve this. We can unleash the pent-up energies and 
productive potential of our people which has been suppressed for 
so long. Economic growth will be integrally linked with job 
creation, the provision of basic infrastructure, massive human 
resource development, and the expansion of our productive 
sector. The Reconstruction and Development Programme aims to 
carve out such a path. We invite business to walk this road 
with us.
