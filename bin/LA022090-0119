THE ABCS OF TAKING VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Popping a vitamin pill is as natural a habit as toothbrushing for legions of 
Americans. By 1992, U.S. vitamin sales will reach nearly $6 billion, according 
to marketing analysts, despite some softening of demand. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics say it's an unnecessary habit -- even potentially hazardous if taken 
to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say regular intake of supplemental vitamins is especially vital, 
since hectic life styles make it difficult to eat a balanced diet. They say 
supplements can also help ward off colds and other ills. 
</P>
<P>
The question's been debated for years, and there's still no consensus. Is 
taking vitamins a waste of time and money? Here are two experts' views: 
</P>
<P>
* YES: Dr. Fredrick Stare, professor of nutrition, Harvard School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
"Vitamins are a waste for the majority of Americans. Nobody in my family takes 
them, nor do I know any colleagues who do. The average person has an adequate 
diet. The focus should be on eating a variety of foods from what we call the 
basic four food groups (milk products, meat/poultry, vegetables/fruits and 
breads/cereals) and maintaining variety within the basic four." 
</P>
<P>
Exercise can't hurt either, he says. "The trouble is, most people consume too 
many calories in relation to their physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
"You can live a long life without vitamins. The last time I took vitamins was 
as a medical school student -- and then only because they were free samples." 
</P>
<P>
* NO: Dr. Gershon M. Lesser, Los Angeles internist and preventive health 
advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"The average person, conscious of the need to reduce daily caloric intake for 
weight maintenance and better health, is not likely to take in adequate levels 
of needed vitamins and minerals on a daily basis. For example, a woman needs 18 
milligrams of iron a day (although the current RDA specifies 15 milligrams). A 
typical diet provides only about 6 milligrams per 1,000 calories, which means 
an average woman must consume 3,000 calories a day, or twice the ideal. To 
complicate matters, food has been aged, packaged, processed and bankrupted of 
its nutritive value. 
</P>
<P>
"Numerous studies have shown that appropriate doses of Vitamins A, C, D and E 
protect against cancer, slow the aging process and heighten immune system 
functioning, and that nearly 30% to 50% of us are deficient in one or more of 
these vitamins at any given time. Vitamins aren't a substitute for good 
nutrition. They are just good insurance."
