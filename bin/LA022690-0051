NASCAR handed out the biggest fine in stock car history Sunday night when Mark 
Martin's Ford Thunderbird was found to have an illegal engine part three hours 
after it won the Pontiac 400 at the Richmond (Va.) International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
The team was fined $40,000 and 46 points in the standings when a spacer between 
the carburetor and intake manifold was found to be a half-inch too tall. NASCAR 
rules limit the height of the spacer to two inches. Martin's was 2 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if it's an advantage or not," said Winston Cup Competition 
Director Dick Beaty. "The rule is to make sure the carburetor and air filter 
fit under the hood." 
</P>
<P>
Martin was allowed to keep the victory, but will take home only $19,150 of his 
$59,150 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
He left the raceway before learning his car had flunked technical inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Martin had won the race when his crew changed just the right-side tires of his 
Ford Thunderbird with 15 laps left. 
</P>
<P>
"There was four choices: two tires on the left, two tires on the right, four 
tires or stay out," Martin said. "The guys made the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
Other challengers changed all four tires. 
</P>
<P>
The move got Martin out of the pits first, and he pulled away from Dale 
Earnhardt over the final 15 laps to win the 400-lap event. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest previous fine came in 1983, when Richard Petty was assessed $35,000 
after his winning car at Charlotte, N.C., was found to have an oversized engine 
and illegal tires. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Brabham, Chip Robinson and Bob Earl combined to win the attrition-filled 
Miami Grand Prix, racing to a one-lap victory in a Nissan prototype. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham and Robinson won at Miami for the second consecutive time, with 
Brabham, who started from the pole for the fourth straight year, winning on the 
downtown street circuit for the third time in four years.
