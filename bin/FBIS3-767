  [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Events in Bophuthatswana 
had been orchestrated by an "unholy" ANC [African National 
Congress]/SACP [South African Communist Party]/National Party 
[NP] alliance which should take responsibility for the loss of 
life in the strife, Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi 
Hartzenberg said on Saturday [12 March]. In a statement, Dr 
Hartzenberg expressed the CP's dismay at the past week's unrest 
in the homeland, whose embattled leader President Lucas Mangope 
was a partner with the CP in the election boycotting Freedom 
Alliance. 
  According to the CP leader, the ANC/SACP/NP alliance had 
orchestrated a "communist revolution" in Bophuthatswana through 
various ways. These included ferrying busloads of ANC activists 
to the area, carefully planning strikes, instigating student and 
youth vandalism, selective Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the 
Nation, ANC armed wing] shooting actions and intimidation of the 
homeland's security forces as well as a "massive SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] and leftist media campaign of 
disinformation". 
  "The killing of four Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] members was an indication of the ruthless 
manner in which the operation had been carried out", Dr 
Hartzenberg said. He reiterated that the CP would never contest 
the election. "To do so would make the CP guilty of complicity 
in the enslaving of the Afrikaner Boerevolk [Boere nation] by a 
communist government of national unity." 
  He further contended that the proclamation of 52 magisterial 
districts as unrest areas was a ruse. "(Law and Order) Minister 
Hernus Kriel's proclamation...is a selective enforcing of his 
powers because he deliberately did not include areas where 
unrest was happening. In not doing so he gave the ANC the 
opportunity to continue their revolution unhindered." 
  The CP leader concluded by calling on all "Boere Afrikaners" 
and those people who had become involved in the "struggle" to 
regroup and consolidate. "The four Afrikaners who offered their 
lives...should serve as an incentive to us to also pay the 
highest price in order to achieve our nation's freedom in our 
own fatherland. The struggle which our fathers started, will 
rage until we die or vanquish," Dr Hartzenberg said.
