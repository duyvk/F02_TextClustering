THE Treuhand privatisation agency has granted sole negotiating rights to
Riva, the Italian steel group, to buy Ekostahl, eastern Germany's largest
steel mill despite strong competition from German manufacturers.
However, the European Commission will need to be convinced that the Riva
plan for Ekostahl will not lead to more over-capacity in the German steel
industry, that its investments contain no hidden subsidies, and that its
plan is economically viable.
Riva is expected to submit its proposals to the Commission later this week,
and the Commission should then recommend its findings to the Council of
Ministers on November 18.
Under the plan, Riva, the Milan-based privately-owned company, will buy 60
per cent of Ekostahl, while the Treuhand will hold the remaining 40 per cent
stake. Together, they will invest DM1.2bn in building a hot rolling mill,
the equivalent of a mini-mill, with an annual capacity of about 900,000
tonnes.
Riva will also guarantee 3,600 jobs, of which 1,700 will be directly
employed at the steel mill. Before 1990, Ekostahl employed more than 12,000
workers, most of whom live in Eisenhuttenstadt, Brandenburg, close to the
Polish border. The mill was producing more than 2.1m tonnes a year.
Mr Hans Kramer, a board member of the Treuhand, said yesterday that the Riva
plan took precedent over its competitors because 'it would make Ekostahl
economically viable and competitive.' Ekostahl is running annual losses of
over DM100m on a turnover of DM1bn.
'We hope the EC will accept the plan because Riva's 60 per cent stake is
private capital,' a Treuhand spokesman said. The agency will use its 40 per
cent stake to modernise the mill. It is unclear if that stake will be sold
once the restructuring and modernisation plans are completed over the next
five years.
But Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation said in a
statement that the Treuhand's decision 'was highly problematical' and it
would add further pressures on overcapacity in the industry.
Riva's German competitors, which included a consortium led by Thyssen and
Preussag, and Hamburger Stahlwerke, had rejected the idea of building a
modern hot rolling mill, largely because they did not want another
competitor entering the steel sector, or increase the country's annual
capacity.
Thyssen and Preussag had offered to buy 50 per cent of Ekostahl's
cold-rolling mill and close down the hot-blast furnace within the next three
years. It would also create 1,000 new jobs in Eisenhuttenstadt through its
subsidiaries.
