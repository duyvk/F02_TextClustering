G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California ("G&K") (Registered Importer No. R-90-007)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE (Model ID 124.051) passenger cars are eligible
for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&K believes is substantially similar is the 1990 Mercedes-Benz
300CE that Daimler Benz A.G. manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 300CE to its U.S.-certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
G&K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 300CE, as
originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.-certified
counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S.-certified 1990 model 300CE is identical to the U.S.-certified
1990 model 300CE with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

the following standards, in the manner indicated:
Standard No. 101 Controls and Displays: 
(a) Substitution of a lens marked "Brake" for a lens with an ECE symbol on the brake failure indicator lamp; (b) installation
