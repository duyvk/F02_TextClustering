Moorpark College's Charles Temple Observatory will be open Tuesday for viewing 
of the partial solar eclipse, which will begin at 8:17 a.m. and last until 
11:58 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Jandorf, an astronomy instructor at the college, said that at the eclipse's 
maximum, the moon will block 36% of the sun. He warned that permanent eye 
damage can occur if the eclipse is viewed directly through telescopes, 
binoculars or sunglasses.

Jandorf advised viewers to focus the image of the sun on a pocket mirror 
directed at a shaded wall. The mirror should be covered by a sheet of paper 
with a small hole punched in it, he said.

<P>
The observatory will offer viewing through several telescopes equipped with 
safety devices.
