PULSAR'S chairman and founder, Mr Alfonso Romo Garza, is not pleased to have
his company described as a conglomerate. Pulsar owns Mexico's biggest
cigarette company, Moderna. It now has 22 per cent of the country's
insurance market, thus making it, he says, the largest Latin American
insurance company. It has an agricultural company, carpet manufacturers and
a stockbroker. But, insists Mr Romo, it is not a conglomerate.
There is no doubting that it is an unusual company. Pulsar's companies'
annual revenues total Dollars 2.5bn and they employ 23,000 people, but
Pulsar's headquarters in Monterrey have just 25. 'This is a highly
decentralised company,' says its chairman.
The core of the company - and the key to its growth from nothing since 1981
 -is its highly profitable cigarette business, which it claims has 55 per
cent of the market. It has the Mexican brand leaders such as Raleigh,
Viceroy, Finesta and Montana but also has the Mexican rights to distribution
of international brands: Winston, Salem, Camel, Dunhill and Gitanes.
Mr Romo acquired control of the company from Grupo Carso, the company of
Telmex magnate, Mr Carlos Slim. Now, thanks to the deregulation of cigarette
prices in the past two years, cigarette prices - and therefore profit
margins - have risen dramatically.
Mr Romo's motivation for moving into the insurance business is based on his
belief that the Mexican economy is heavily underinsured. Premium income is
equivalent to just 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with up
to 8 per cent in industrialised countries and in some other Latin American
states. If Mexico grows, therefore, insurance premiums should grow even
faster.
His interest in agriculture derives from the company's connection with
tobacco farmers. Almost all Moderna's tobacco leaf is sourced in Mexico. The
company therefore has links with farmers of 20,000 hectares of tobacco. It
also has developed relationships with 10,000 hectares of fruit and vegetable
growers, with an eye on the export market. Some observers doubt the synergy
of these two elements of the company's business, but Mr Romo is enthusiastic
about recent agricultural reforms which he believes will further help this
side of the business - by increasing the availability of credit to farmers
for example.
Mr Romo does not seem inclined to let his business stand still. In
particular, he is enthusiastic about the prospects of new markets overseas
for the cigarette company. Having sought areas where he could compete on an
equal footing with the US tobacco giants, he has identified markets in
eastern Europe, Russia and China for expansion.
