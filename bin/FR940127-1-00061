At the 1993 Regular Meeting of ICCAT, the quota for take of the species in the western Atlantic was reduced from the 1991
level by 25 percent of 1994 and by another 30 percent for 1995, for a 55 percent total reduction since Sweden submitted
its resolution to COP8. In addition, the quota for Japanese fishing vessels, in the central Atlantic, whose harvest
had been 450 mt annually from the western Atlantic and about 1,000 mt annually from the eastern Atlantic, was capped
at 1,300 mt for the 2-year period 1994-95.
Progress was made on other conservation measures, including the development of a Bluefin Statistical Document (similar
to a CITES certificate of origin), which would be required by all ICCAT countries for the importation of bluefin tuna.
This document is already required for frozen bluefin tuna imports. It will be partially implemented for fresh tuna
by June 1994, and full implementation is scheduled for December 1994, when the document must be validated by the appropriate
government official. An intersessional meeting is scheduled for spring 1994 to discuss, among other things, the
use of trade measures as an enforcement tool. Thus, a proposal to list this species in Appendix II may not be warranted
at this time based on the progress at the last two ICCAT meetings.
However, ICCAT has not yet fully implemented the quota reductions or the Bluefin Statistical Document Program, and
other measures may be necessary for ICCAT to take with respect to non-ICCAT countries in order to supplement the existing
conservation regime. Therefore, the Service requests comments on the merits for an Appendix II listing of the entire
Atlantic population, particularly with respect to collecting trade date concerning non-ICCAT countries.
8. Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus)
EIA proposed that the whale shark be considered for CITES protection, and subsequently provided a draft proposal
to include this species in Appendix II. Whale sharks are large filter feeders and exist in the temperate seas throughout
the world. Whale sharks are vulnerable to commercial harpoon gear and collisions with vessels. Whale sharks have
supported small to medium commercial fisheries in India, Pakistan, China, the Philippines, and Senegal, where catches
may be increasing. The flesh is eaten fresh or after being slated and dried.
The whale shark is slow growing and may produce few young, and consequently, may be easily overexploited. The NMFS
Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed whale sharks in the large coastal species group,
and this group of sharks is considered to be overfished in the Northwest Atlantic and to have declined off southern
California. However, this species does not appear to be an important fisheries species.
Because of the recent increases in worldwide catches of sharks for the meat and fins, and for medicinal purposes, the
Service is requesting information this species, but without more specific information indicating population declines
or increases in trade, the Service may not have sufficient information to warrant submission of a proposal for this
species.
9. Requiem Sharks (Carcharhinidae spp.) and Hammerhead Sharks (Sphyrnidae spp.)
These species were proposed for review for inclusion in Appendix II or III, by the National Audubon Society in 1991.
At that time, the Service did not believe that sufficient information was available to propose these species for consideration
at COP8. However, the Service is re-examining this recommendation in preparation for COP9.
These species are normally targeted by commercial shark longline and gillnet fisheries and are also subject to take
in recreational fisheries. The NMFS Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed these sharks
in the large coastal species group, but many individuals of these species make extensive migrations. In the preparation
for development of the management plan, a peer review of effort by NMFS and non-NMFS experts evaluated the available
information and determined that the large coastal species group of sharks was overfished in the Northwest Atlantic.
As a consequence, catch quotas imposed for the large coastal shark species were set at levels representing a 30 percent
drop pattern. These sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation.
Because of the recent increases in worldwide catches of sharks for the meat and fins, and for medicinal purposes, the
Service is requesting information on these species. However, without more specific information indicating specific
population declines or increases in trade, the Service may not have sufficient information to warrant submission
of any proposal for these species.
