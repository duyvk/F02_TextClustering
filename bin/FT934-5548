An inventor campaigning for a harmonised European plug and socket system has
hit back at claims from UK manufacturers that replacing the UK's three-pin
system could cost Pounds 20bn and raise serious safety issues.
Mr Simon Hossack, a Hertfordshire-based inventor, says the adoption in the
UK of a proposed new two-pin plug would stimulate the contracting and cable
industries, be of great benefit to appliance manufacturers and save
consumers hundreds of millions of pounds a year.
Mr Hossack's attack is the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter debate in
the electrical industry over the future of the UK's 13-amp plug with its
three rectangular pins, introduced in 1947.
Last month Mr David Dossett, director of the Electrical Installation
Equipment Manufacturers Association, said the two-pin system:
Could cost about Pounds 1,000 to introduce for each of 20m UK households.
Would make redundant about half of the Pounds 1.3bn capital employed by the
UK's 20 plug and socket manufacturers.
Could raise an issue of 'dangerous compatibility', because the present
two-pin Euro-plug could be pushed into a three-pin socket with potentially
lethal consequences.
But Mr Hossack, who in the late 1980s invented Le Plug, an adaptor that
allows the Euro-plug to run on the British system, described the
association's arguments as 'absolute tosh' and deliberate misrepresentation.
He said the proposed new harmonised plug, which has thicker pins than the
existing Euro-plug, cannot be fitted into a UK socket, and even the
Euro-plug could only be inserted through deliberate misuse.
The Pounds 20bn figure, he said, was a worst-case scenario that would never
become reality.
With an adaptor such as Le Plug there would be no need to replace plugs and
sockets, and new houses could be fitted with the new sockets.
He said it was inconceivable that the costs for manufacturers of replacing
equipment with lathes to produce round pins would amount to Pounds 650m.
The association says it does not oppose harmonisation but is trying to kill
the new plug, which has been proposed by Cenelec, the European standards
setting body, and could eventually become the world standard.
Mr Hossack wants an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and the European Commission's competition directorate into the issue and its
handling by the British Standards Institution.
He claims UK manufacturers are over-represented on the institution's plugs
and sockets committee, which meets today to discuss the issue. The
institution rejects the charge, and says the committee includes
manufacturers, consumers, safety experts and academics.
