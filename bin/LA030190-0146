Twenty-one Californians have been arrested for buying animal parts, selling raw 
animal furs without a trapping license and poaching, the state Fish and Game 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests were made in San Francisco, Humboldt, Modoc, Shasta and Orange 
counties, said DeWayne Johnston, chief of the department's wildlife protection 
division. During a 15-month investigation, two undercover agents bought and 
sold hundreds of pelts and animal parts. Many of the animals were trapped or 
shot out of season without hunting licenses. Some animals were on the federal 
endangered species list.
