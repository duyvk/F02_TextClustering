Ozark asserts that the Commission's order is not at all clear whether it is relying upon the modified definition of
"control" to support its decision here. If the Commission's decision rests at all on "whether acting alone or in
conjunction with others" language, Ozark submits that the Commission's decision is in error. Ozark argues that
the effect of the additional language is to establish "control" in a 1% voting interest owner of a corporation. Ozark
asserts that the language creates an irrebuttable presumption of "control" by anyone holding at least a 10% voting
interest in a corporation, contrary to the clear statement in the balance of the regulation that the presumption of
control is rebuttable. Ozark contends these two effects result from the indisputable fact that any interest holder
must act with the requisite plurality in order for any particular action to be taken by a corporation or a partnership.
Ozark states that in its case unanimity is required for most actions so all partners must vote in the affirmative in
order for particular action to be taken. Ozark asserts that the fact that unanimity is required, again, does not constitute
control but, rather, evidences a lack of control. Accordingly, Ozark submits that the modified definition is inconsistent
with the existence of a rebuttable presumption, is arbitrary and capricious, and lacks any basis in reasoned decisionmaking.
2. Commission Ruling 
The Commission rejects Ozark's request for rehearing. Ozark argues that the Commission's definition of "control"
is inconsistent with the existence of a rebuttable presumption. We disagree. Section 161.2 states that "control
(including the terms `controlling,' `controlled by,' and `under common control with') includes, but is not limited
to, the possession, directly or indirectly and whether acting alone or in conjunction with others, of the authority
to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a company. A voting interest of 10 percent or more creates
a rebuttable presumption of control."
25
 In Order No. 497-A, the Commission specifically addressed the issue of joint venture pipelines and stated that
overlapping interests create an incentive to grant an affiliate preference.
26
 The Commission applied the definition in section 161.2 to several pipelines that had requested rehearing, including
High Island Offshore System, U-T Offshore System, Trailblazer Pipeline Company, Sea Robin Pipeline Company,
Northern Border Pipeline Company and Great Lakes Gas Transmission Company.
27
 In 
Tenneco,
 the court upheld the definition of control and the way in which the Commission applied it to Northern Border Pipeline
Company. In considering Ozark's petition for review, the court remanded the Commission's 
application
 of the term "control" but not the definition of the term. Thus, Ozark's request for review of the definition of control
is a collateral attack on Order No. 497-A and the Commission rejects it.

To consider whether there is control here, we will review all the evidence Ozark has submitted on the issue. On March
10, 1987, Ozark filed an application under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience
and necessity. In that application, Ozark stated that it is a partnership and submitted its partnership agreement,
which shows that Ozark is jointly owned by four partners,
28
 that the partnership will be managed by a management committee, which will consist of equal representatives from
each partner, and will be operated by OPGC. In addition, OPGC selects the President of Ozark, who also acts as the CEO
and the Chairman of the management committee. On July 5, 1988, Ozark emphasized that its General Partnership agreement
specifies that no action may be taken by the management committee except by unanimous approval. On January 3, 1993,
Ozark presented, for the first time, a partial copy of a corporate resolution dated June 26, 1991. This states that
"the President of Ozark or his designee is hereby authorized to execute interruptible transportation agreements
on behalf of Ozark." Because Ozark's partners ceded to the President the authority to enter into interruptible transportation
agreements, no partnership vote is required. All of Ozark's firm capacity is committed to Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation. Therefore, Ozark claims that its partners cannot "control"
transportation either affirmatively or negatively through veto power.

Ozark's owners are: 
1. Ozark Gas Pipeline Corporation (OPGC), which is a direct subsidiary of USX Corporation. Other subsidiaries include,
TXO Production Company, Marathon Oil Company and Delhi Gas Marketing Corporation. The activities of TXO Production
Company, the marketing affiliate, have been subsumed into Marathon Oil Company. However, TXO Production Corporation
still ships on Ozark, as does Delhi Gas Marketing Corporation, another marketing affiliate. 
2. Tennessee Ozark Gas Pipe Company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, which
is in turn, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco, Inc. Tennessee's marketing affiliate is Tenngasco Corporation
(Tenngasco), which is a shipper on Ozark. 
3. Columbia Gulf Transmission, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Columbia Gas System, Inc. Columbia Gas'
marketing affiliate, Columbia Gas Development Corporation ships on Ozark; and 
4. Caney River Transmission Company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ONEOK, Inc. 
</FOOTNOTE>
We disagree. The partners still have authority to direct the management and policies of Ozark and could, at any time,
revoke the authority over interruptible transportation from the President. Moreover, under the terms of the partnership
agreement, OPGC selects the President of Ozark and operates Ozark. OPGC's marketing affiliates ship on Ozark. OPGC
has the requisite control described in section 161.2 of the Commission's regulations because it operates Ozark and,
through the President it selects, manages the pipeline.
