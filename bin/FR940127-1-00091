(b) When a majority of trust interest in a tract has consented, the Secretary may issue revocable road use and construction
permits for removal of forest products over and across such land. In addition, the Secretary may act for individual
owners when: 
(1) One or more of the individual owner(s) of the land or of an interest therein is a minor or a person non compos mentis,
and the Secretary finds that such grant, in total or for an interest therein, will cause no substantial injury to the
land or the owner, which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages; 
(2) The whereabouts of the owner(s) of the land or an interest therein are unknown, and the owner(s) of any interests
therein whose whereabouts are known or majority thereof, consent to the grant; 
(3) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or interest therein have not been determined, and the Secretary
finds the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any owner thereof, provided that once the heirs or devisees
of the deceased owner are determined, their consent is obtained; or 
(4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain the
consent of the majority and finds that such grant in total or an interest therein will cause no substantial injury to
the land or the owner(s), which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages. 
(c) Nothing in this section shall preclude acquisition of rights-of-way over Indian lands, subchapter H, 25 CFR part
169, or conflict with provisions of that part.

Forest development. 
Forest development pertains to forest land management activities undertaken to improve the productivity of commercial

investments to enhance productivity of commercial forest land with emphasis on accomplishing on-the-ground projects.
Forest development funds will be used to re-establish, maintain, and/or improve growth of commercial timber species

using benefit-cost analyses as one of the determinants in establishing priorities for project funding. 
Sect.163.33
Administrative appeals. 
Any challenge to action taken by an approving officer or subordinate official exercising delegated authority from
the Secretary shall be exclusively through administrative appeal or as provided in the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638, as amended). Such appeal(s) shall be filed in accordance with
the provisions of 25 CFR part 2, Appeals from administrative actions, and any other applicable regulations covering
appeals and shall not stay any action unless otherwise directed by the Secretary. 
Sect.163.34

Actions under the regulations in this part will be reviewed for potential environmental impacts, under the National
