insurers - Growth and a poor domestic service is attracting US and European
investors

US and European investors are manoeuvring swiftly to take stakes in Mexico's
fledgling insurance sector. They are drawn by a market that has been
ill-served by domestic companies and is growing rapidly as the country's
incomes rise and inflation stabilises.
In the past three years the US's Aetna, Metropolitan Life, New York Life
Insurance Company, and Principal Financial Group, Grupo Santander of Spain,
and Commercial Union of the UK, among others, have taken up to the maximum
permitted 49 per cent stake in Mexican insurance companies.
In all, some 13 foreign insurers are minority owners of Mexican insurance
companies.
Asemex, the insurance group recently privatised for Dollars 582m, is looking
for a foreign partner, according to Mr Angel Rodriguez, the new company
president. The insurance company and Mr Rodriguez's financial group,
Mexival-Banpais, then plan to make a public offering on the New York Stock
Exchange.
Foreign insurers hope to bring to their Mexican counterparts capital,
technology, and global distribution. The Mexicans, meanwhile, will
contribute knowledge of the local market. Foreign companies generally have
better distribution systems, financial management and product development
skills than Mexican insurers, says Mr Bill Poortvliet, executive
vice-president of Metropolitan Life.
But is there sufficient room for all the foreign companies seeking a stake
in Mexican companies? While profit margins are high, many Mexican insurers
have high costs, and may be unprepared for competition.
'We expect some consolidation,' says Mr Poortvliet, whose company joined
last year with Santander to take a 49 per cent stake in Genesis, a new
Mexican life insurance company. 'Not every company is going to be a winner.'
The North American Free Trade Agreement will intensify competition by fully
opening up the sector to US and Canadian insurance companies. Under the
treaty, US or Canadian companies with at least 10 per cent of shares in an
Mexican insurance company can increase their holdings to 100 per cent by
1996. Other companies will have to wait until the year 2000. Mexico's
foreign investment law will permit up to 49 per cent investment in Mexican
insurers for non-US and Canadian companies.
There are also doubts as to whether foreigners are prepared for doing
business in Mexico, and ready to join forces with Mexican partners.
Commercial Union, the UK insurer, this year wrote off its 44.3 per cent
stake in Seguros La Republica after several executives defrauded the
company, and the UK insurer refused to inject more capital.
CU complained at the time that regulation in Mexico's insurance industry was
insufficiently advanced, and warned other companies to pick their partners
with caution, and conduct extensive due diligence.
The foreigners nevertheless keep coming, attracted by an under-developed
market. The average Mexican only spends about Dollars 55 a year on
insurance, while insurance premiums account for just 1.5 per cent of
Mexico's GDP, against 3 per cent in Chile, and 8.8 per cent in the US.
Investors tend to dismiss cultural explanations - such as Mexicans'
tolerance of risk and a somewhat fatalist attitude to death - for such low
insurance penetration, Instead, they blame Mexico's economic crisis in the
1980s.
Mexico's wages fell 40 per cent between 1982 and 1990, leaving little money
for insurance policies. Inflation was high throughout the decade, playing
havoc with calculations of the future value of life insurance coverage, and
reducing the incentive to save through such schemes.
Insurance companies are now convinced the conditions are present for a sharp
increase in the market. Mexico's inflation is down to single digits; incomes
have been steadily, if unspectacularly, rising; and the savings rate is
picking up.
This should bode particularly well for life insurance, which comprises just
one-third of the total Mexican insurance market, a much lower proportion
than that in other countries: only 2 per cent of Mexicans own a life
insurance policy. However, the sector is now growing fast, posting an
average 28 per cent a year gain in dollar terms since 1987.
The government's new state-sponsored individual pension scheme should
increase savings, and further boost the life industry. Mr Palden Namgyal,
vice-president of JP Morgan, which has advised on several insurance
transactions in Mexico, reckons that life insurance companies will play an
important part in managing savings generated by the retirement scheme.
The extension of credit - for the first time in a decade - is having a
beneficial impact, by increasing the number of first-time car and house
owners, and generating demand for car and property insurance. Banks in
Mexico generally demand insurance policies as a condition for lending money.
The question hanging over the new insurance companies is whether they and
their partners are the best equiped to meet the explosive demand all
participants predict.
Mexico's growing financial and industrial integration with the US is likely
to ensure that profit margins in the industry eventually fall to levels in
the US, and that, over the long term, only the most efficient companies will
survive.
