  [Excerpts] King Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulus has 
withdrawn from the meeting of top leaders scheduled for tomorrow 
and on Thursday. [passage omitted] 
  A spokesaman for the state president's office said in 
reaction to the king's request that Mr. de Klerk felt that the 
present situation regarding the violence warranted the holding 
of the meting before the weekend. Mr. de Klerk said efforts to 
hold the summit as soon as possible would continue, and that he 
was trying to get in touch with King Goodwill about the matter.
