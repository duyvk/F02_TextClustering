<F> [Statement issued by Interior and National Security Minister </F>
Jean-Claude Dobanga Boti in Bangui on 6 March--recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, dear fellow citizens. The 
Central African Republic has installed political democracy. It 
has become a state where there is the rule of law. Since his 
investiture, the elected president of the Republic has always 
preached dialogue with all the social and political groups of 
the nation. He has made social justice and dialogue the 
watchwords of his national policy. Unfortunately, this political 
will for reconciliation and national reconstruction is not 
accepted by a good number of Central Africans. 
  As the minister of interior and national security, and to 
support the head of state's policy, I have continued to receive 
in my office some lost sons of the country who deliberately take 
pleasure in acts of social agitation and socio-political 
upheavals. Despite my appeals for order and national unity, I 
have observed and recorded facts of partisan dissentions and 
disorders, marked by (?obscene) and irresponsible demonstrations 
organized by small groups still pining for an era fresh in the 
minds; an ear which supported the very people who caused its 
fall [words indistinct] arms. Some people have organized 
hotbeds in some areas in the capital with the sole aim of 
disturbing public peace and disrupting the smooth running of our 
democratic and republican institutions. These hotbeds are 
marked by acts of aggression against strangers and French 
technical assistants. These are innocent targets who are faced 
with armed attacks in their homes. 
  All these purely barbaric acts only aim at destabilizing the 
democratically elected and recently installed government. 
Considering the manifest dishonesty insincerity of these [word 
indistinct] agitators (?sponsored and trained) by [words 
indistinct] which mistake democracy with anarchy, I make it my 
duty, as the minister in charge of our country's internal 
security and guarantor of public order and (?peace), to make a 
public appeal to the national and international community. I 
appeal to the organizations for the defense of human rights to 
witness this situation. I cannot continue to tolerate such acts 
of political agitation, social upheavals, and public disorder in 
a state where there is the rule of law. 
  As the minister of interior and national security, I have 
the 
duty to install state authority in order to guarantee the 
regalia of a democratic state. So, beginning with this warning, 
I am giving firm instructions to the competent police to ask 
them to ensure, in the implementation of the country's laws, 
that all the (?enemies) of democracy are exposed. Thank you.
