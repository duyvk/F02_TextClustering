Consistent with the NPRM, the final changes to 
Sect.Sect.404.1579(e)(2), 404.1594(e)(2), 416.994(b)(4)(ii) and 
416.994a(g)(2) also explain that we will consider the factors 
described in Sect.Sect.404.911 and 416.1411 for purposes of determining 
generally whether an individual has good cause for failure to 
cooperate in a review of his or her entitlement to benefits based 
on disability. (Current Sect.Sect.404.911 and 416.1411 explain the 
factors we consider in determining whether an individual has good 
cause for missing a deadline to request review of a determination 
or decision under our administrative review process. As 
explained later in this preamble, we are amending Sect.Sect.404.911 and 
416.1411, which apply to title II and title XVI cases, 
respectively, to provide explicitly for the consideration of the 
limitations described in section 10305 of OBRA 1989 in 
determining whether an individual has good cause for missing a 
deadline to request review.) We are also revising 
Sect.Sect.404.1586(d) and 416.986(c) to clarify that we will 
consider the factors described in Sect.Sect.404.911 and 416.1411, 
respectively, for purposes of determining generally whether an 
individual has good cause for failure to cooperate in a review of 
his or her continuing entitlement to title II benefits, or 
continuing eligibility for title XVI benefits, based on 
blindness. 
&bull;Without Fault_Waiver of Adjustment or Recovery of 
Overpayments 
Under sections 204(b) and 1631(b)(1)(B) of the Act, 
recovery or adjustment of overpayments to a title II or title XVI 
beneficiary may be waived in situations where the individual is 
without fault in connection with the overpayment and recovery or 
adjustment would defeat the purposes of the program or would be 
against equity and good conscience or, with respect to the 
title XVI program, would impede efficient or effective 
administration of title XVI because of the small amount involved. 
Our existing regulations explain that in determining whether an 
individual was without fault, all pertinent factors surrounding 
the overpayment will be considered, including the individual's 
age, intelligence, education, and physical and mental 
capabilities. 
Section 10305(b) of OBRA 1989 amended section 204(b) of the 
Act to provide that the Secretary, in making determinations or 
decisions of "without fault" for purposes of section 204(b), must 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) the individual has. In addition, the amendment 
to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act made by section 10305(e) of OBRA 
1989 provides that, for the purposes of the title XVI program, 
the Secretary must take these same limitations into account in 
determining, among other things, whether an individual is without 
fault. 
We are making the following changes in our regulations which 
implement sections 204(b) and 1631(b)(1)(B) of the Act to reflect 
the pertinent amendments made by section 10305. 
&bull;Amend Sect.404.507 to provide that in making 
determinations of without fault with respect to title II 
overpayments, we will take into account any physical, mental, 
educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of 
facility with the English language) the individual has.
