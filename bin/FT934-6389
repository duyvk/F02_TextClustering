On Tuesday Sviatoslav Richter played Bach in the Barbican, with Christoph
Eschenbach and the English Chamber Orchestra. It was only a pendant to his
solo recital in the Festival Hall on Sunday, but a costly one: Pounds 40 for
any seat in the stalls or the mid-front circle.
First, Eschenbach conducted a reasonably trim, moderately lively account of
Bach's Suite in D. Then, after the interval, Richter stalked on to play the
D major and G minor 'piano' concerti, the composer's own re-writes of his
unimprovable violin concerti in E and in A minor. (The keys had to be
lowered because the harpsichords of his day did not reach as far as the
violin's top E). Finally the conductor-pianist joined Richter for the C
minor, two-keyboard version of a concerto Bach probably wrote for violin and
oboe.
There were no disturbing signs of over-rehearsal, neither in the Suite nor
in the concerted pieces. Anyway, in the concerti Richter's and Eschenbach's
big Yamaha grands often rendered the ECO strings all but inaudible - they
might have been playing almost anything.
Though there are serious arguments for using the modern solo instrument that
Bach never knew, the musical imbalance here was discomfiting. Not least
because the ECO's continuo players had from the start included a
harpsichord, the very instrument for which Bach intended his concerto solos:
we could not help but notice how much happier the balance was between him
and his string colleagues than between them and the soloist.
Watching a brooding, tight-jawed Richter performance (he is 78 this year) is
always rather awe-inspiring. Presumably that justified the seat-prices, for
there was nothing greatly remarkable in his Bach interpretations. Eschewing
the expressive nuances available on the modern piano, he played everything
robustly, firmly and cleanly, without any special virtuosity in his solo
breaks. It seemed an exercise in heroically selfless restraint; and in the
two-keyboard concerto, Eschenbach matched him.
We might have been hearing domestic play-throughs - except in the 'Adagio e
piano sempre' of the solo concerto in D, where Richter drew out the lyrical
line to an elevated height. That was the redeeming passage of an otherwise
low-profile concert. I got home in time to watch a beady-eyed BBC-1
programme about overpaid, underskilled conductors, such as record companies
nowadays promote far beyond their half-formed merits. It was the most
intelligent and usefully mischievous TV study of the real-life classical
music business that I have seen, and we watched it free; it was at least
twice as interesting as the laid-back, low-cost but pricey Richter
exhibition.
