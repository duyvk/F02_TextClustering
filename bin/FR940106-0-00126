Paragraph (g) of this section is also revised to reflect the 1988 Amendment to section 236 of the Act which added remedial
education as being approvable as classroom training. Training designed to enhance the employability of individuals
by upgrading basic skills, through remedial education or English-as-second-language courses, are considered
as remedial education approvable under Sect.617.22(a) if all the approval criteria in that section are met. A training
program of remedial education only may now be approved for an individual if he or she possesses occupational skills
and needs only remedial education to obtain employment. Ordinarily, remedial education is made part of a broader
skills training program as defined in Sect.617.22(f) (3). 
J. Revision of Sect.617.22(a)(5)
Section 617.22(a) lists six criteria that must be met for approval of training. These are intended to assure that training
will lead to a specific occupational goal. Clause (5) of Sect.617.22(a) deals with a worker's personal qualifications
to undertake and complete such training. The Department's interpretation of this clause has been changed to add "financial
resources" to those personal qualifications, and this change is included in amended Sect.617.22(a)(5). 
Change 3 to GAL 15-90, dated July 17, 1991, (56 FR 46331, 46333), announced a change in the definition of the criterion
for approval of training in Section 236(a)(1) (E) of the Act, by adding "financial resources" to the existing physical
and mental qualifications which must be reviewed in making a determination that a worker is able to undertake and complete
training, as set out for criterion (E) in Section G.1. of Attachment A to GAL 15-90 and incorporated in this final
rule. This change was made to enhance the worker's ability to complete training by stressing that the duration of approved
training should be commensurate with the worker's financial resources. 
Training may be approved for a duration not to exceed 104 weeks under a single certification, as limited in amended
Sect.617.22(f)(2). However, combined UI and TRA entitlement is available to workers for a maximum of 78 weeks. When
the duration of training exceeds the remaining weeks of UI and TRA payments, a worker's income support may end or be
substantially reduced before completing the approved training program. This situation often results in workers
dropping out of training. 
The amended Sect.617.22(a)(5) will require State agency 
staff to explain to workers seeking approval of training in which the duration of training exceeds their remaining
weeks of UI and TRA payments, that in the absence of other financial resources such training may not be appropriate.
When the worker's financial resources are not commensurate with a training program suitable to the worker, the training
requirement may be waived under Sect.617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B).
K. Revision of Sect.617.22(f) 
An individual who satisfies the six criteria for approval of training in Sect.617.22(a) may be enrolled in a training
program that does not exceed 104 weeks in length. (See Sect.617.22(f)(2).) Inquiries were received on whether an
individual may pursue more than one training program under a single certification or whether training under a certification
is limited by the 104-weeks time provision. To eliminate any uncertainty on this matter, clause (2) on length of training
has been revised to state more clearly that the maximum duration for any approvable training program is 104 weeks and
no individual shall be entitled to more than one training program under a single certification. 
For purposes of part 617, a new clause (3) is added to Sect.617.22(f), which provides a definition for a "training
program". Subclause (i) of clause (3) provides that a training program may consist of a single course or a group of
courses designed and approved by the State agency for an individual to meet a specific occupational goal. Subclause
(ii) of clause (3) authorizes State agencies to amend an individual's approved training program, when the duration
of training is less than 104 weeks, to add a course or courses designed to satisfy unforeseen needs, such as the need
for remedial education or specific occupational skills. However, the amended training program may not exceed the
104-week time limitation in clause (2). 
Clause (4), previously clause (3), is amended to clarify that the hours in a day and the days in a week an individual attends
an approved training program must be full time commensurate with the standards of the training facility. The purpose
of this amendment is to ensure that hours of training per week and length of the training program are scheduled in a manner
that the individual will develop the skills needed to achieve a specific occupational goal in a reasonable time period
and at a reasonable cost. Any week in which training is less than full time will still count as a full week for the purposes
of the 104-week limitation. 
L. Revision of Sect.617.26
Section 617.26, entitled "Approval of other training including interstate," was not among the sections of regulations
proposed to be amended in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988. However, rethinking occasioned by the
1988 Amendments led to the conclusion that there is a need to clarify, and in some respects alter, the roles and responsibilities
of liable States and agent States in the administration of the TAA program. Among the OTCA amendments that caused such
rethinking were those making training an entitlement and an eligibility requirement for basic TRA, and the provisions
of amended section 231(c) on training waivers. In addition, comments received on related sections of the proposed
regulations were considered in reaching this conclusion. The redescription of liable State and agent State roles
and responsibilities was announced in Change 2 to GAL 15-90, which was published at 56 FR 46331, 46332. 
The present Sect.617.26, written in 1975, provides that the agent State shall be responsible for the selection and
approval of training, and will pay any training related costs, and that the liable State is responsible for determining
eligibility for TRA, job search and relocation allowances, and may approve and purchase training provided that certain
conditions are met. Although the respective roles of the liable and agent States were spelled out, the section was
silent on the legal relationships and the appellate authority in the case of determinations made by the agent State.
In addition, there were some overlapping responsibilities relative to training approval and payment of training
costs. The regulations as revised in this document address these issues and, in general, deal more comprehensively
with the roles and responsibilities of liable and agent States in administering the TAA program. Accordingly, 
Sect.617.26 is retitled "Liable and agent State responsibilities" and the roles of liable and agent States are
delineated.
