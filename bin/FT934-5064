As one who makes much of his roots in Midlands manufacturing, chancellor
Kenneth Clarke might be expected to be nice to British industry. In
rhetorical terms, he took every opportunity yesterday to declare how close
industry was to his heart. How much this means in practice may be a matter
for the small print of the Budget rather than the headlines.
In broad terms, industry expressed itself satisfied yesterday. There was
grumbling from the engineers and machine tool makers, which had urged the
necessity of further tax breaks for investment. But on the big question of
whether the recovery would be killed by taxes, there was general relief. A
total of Pounds 1.7bn in new taxation next year and Pounds 4.9bn the year
after, it was felt, was a burden the consumer could live with.
The Confederation of British Industry last night applauded Mr Clarke's
'tough decisions' on public spending, and said the budget 'should provide a
sound base for continued non-inflationary recovery'. The traditionally more
hawkish Institute of Directors expressed relief at the limited scale of tax
increases, while arguing Mr Clarke could have gone even further on public
spending cuts. The British Retail Consortium said: 'This is a skilfully
balanced Budget, which will help boost the confidence of both retailer and
consumer.'
One reason for the chancellor's solicitude towards industry could be gleaned
from the details accompanying the speech. In spite of last September's
devaluation of sterling, the government is plainly still concerned that the
balance of payments deficit might inhibit recovery.
Mr Clarke went out of his way yesterday to point out that in the past three
months, exports had risen 14 per cent: 'a convincing demonstration of the
strength of British manufacturing today.'
The Treasury evidently expects more of the same. In Mr Norman Lamont's March
Budget, the current account deficit for next year was forecast at Pounds
18.5bn. The official forecast has now shrunk to half that - just Pounds
9.5bn. At the same time, profitability of UK companies, says the official
Red Book, is expected to be well up in 1993 on its 1992 level.
'In 1994 it is expected to pick up further as recovery strengthens, labour
costs remain in check and pressure on margins eases further', the Red Book
says.
Similarly, business investment is forecast to rise by 3.75 per cent in
volume terms next year. This is despite the fact that, as the Red Book
concedes, it was actually 1.75 per cent down in the first nine months of
this year. Here as elsewhere, there are hints that some of the chancellor's
assumptions many be a trifle heroic.
This may also apply to the other side of the equation: public spending.
Several respected economists were starting to mutter yesterday that the
projected cutbacks looked implausible. They are, however, central to the
chancellor's message to business.
Government spending, he said, constituted a substantial risk for business
next year. 'Business can only plan ahead if it knows government borrowing is
under control. My task today is to instil that confidence.'
In some cases, it sounds as if cuts in spending are to come out of
industry's hide. The budgets for roads and housing are to be cut, in hopes
of getting the same output. Construction prices next year, Mr Clarke said
ominously, would be more than 25 per cent lower than in 1989, so the
programmes could be maintained in real terms for much less money.
Some other details yesterday might give rise to suspicion. The move to stop
reimbursing sick pay - except for the smallest companies - will cost
industry Pounds 700m a year for the next three years. Doubtless, this will
be partly offset by lower employer national insurance contributions. It
remains to be seen, however, how the two changes will interact in individual
cases.
Similarly, the airlines were distinctly miffed at the decision to tax air
passengers a collective Pounds 330m a year on leaving British airports. As
one airline chief remarked, it rather looked as if the government was
reluctant to impose VAT, since this would logically entail also taxing rail
passengers ahead of privatisation. Having instead stumbled upon the neat
expedient of stinging businessmen flying at their companies' expense, the
Treasury might find it hard to resist coming back for more in future.
There was also widespread scepticism in the construction industry over the
list of projects to be financed by the private sector. The only new item on
the list, it seems, is the new air traffic control centre for Scotland. As
for the grandiose scheme for the private management of motorways, the
construction companies would prefer to see the Treasury's proposed terms
before getting excited. As Mr Clarke himself conceded yesterday, the private
finance system requires 'a complete change of culture in government'.
When it comes to small businesses, Mr Clarke deserves full marks for trying.
Helping small business, he said, was his particular priority this year. Some
of the moves on deregulation and the cutting of red tape were familiar,
having already been trumpeted by the industry minister Mr Michael Heseltine.
But the removal of the requirement for a statutory audit for small companies
is a genuine innovation. So, in the separate field of small company cash
flow, is the proposal that companies should be legally entitled to charge
interest on overdue bills.
The proposals for increasing the supply of risk capital for small companies
 -the installation of investment trusts for unquoted companies and a
replacement for the generally reviled Business Expansion Scheme - probably
amount to little. But as employers' organisations acknowledged yesterday, it
all adds up to a sustained attempt to help out the small businessmen who
form the Tory party's natural constituency.
Above all, Mr Clarke has shown adroitness in allowing expectations to build
up of VAT and other tax increases, then deflate them. There was an unusual
emphasis on keeping the consumer happy. Even the rise in excise on wine, the
chancellor said, would not take effect until after Christmas, while there is
no extra duty on beer at all.
Mr John Clare, managing director of Dixons, the electrical stores group,
doubtless spoke for many shopkeepers yesterday. 'It was nowhere near as bad
as we expected. The expectations of tax increases in the Budget caused a lot
of uncertainty in the retail business - people don't want to spend until
they know where they stand. That's gone now. Let's get on with Christmas.'
