  [Excerpts] Durban March 6 SAPA -- Groups of killers swept 
through an African National Congress [ANC] stronghold in the 
war-torn Bhambayi shack settlement north of Durban late on 
Saturday [5 March] night, leaving a trail of blood and 
confusion. There were conflicting reports as to the number of 
people killed, with residents saying eight people were dead and 
seven were injured, while police said 11 were murdered. 
  What prompted the killings mystified residents, but a local 
ANC leader attributed them to the ongoing conflict between the 
rival "red" and "green" gangs, linked to the ANC and Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP] respectively. 
  Residents in the ANC strongholds of Angola and Cuba -- an 
area of about 3km square -- reported that gunmen attacked 
different homes between 10 pm and midnight. [passage omitted] 
  Saturday's killing spree was probably aimed at stirring up 
conflict in the area and linked to rivalry between the reds and 
the greens. 
  Mr Blose [ANC's "office bearer in the area"] said Cuba and 
Angola had been peaceful recently and the last killings had been 
in adjoining Congo in January when nine people died. Black SA 
Defence Force soldiers who spoke Zulu should be deployed to keep 
the peace as joint ANC/IFP/police monitoring of the area had 
shown limited results, said Mr Blose. 
  He said Saturday's attacks would probably lead to an 
escalation of violence in Bhambayi, where more than 250 lives 
have been lost since conflict erupted in late 1992. 
  The settlement appeared calm on Sunday.
