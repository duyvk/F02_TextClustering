Dotson argues that the Secretary's position, if implemented, will hurt only poor drug abusers because rich ones,
who presumably will have paid into the Social Security system, will be eligible to receive OASDI benefits under Title
II of the Act. This argument misses the mark for the simple reason that OASDI claimants, just like SSI claimants, must
navigate the same five-step administrative process, the first of which requires that the claimant not be engaging
in SGA. Compare 42 U.S.C. 423(d)(1)(A) and 20 CFR Sect.404.1520(a) (Title II) with 42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)(3)(A) and
20 CFR Sect.416.920(a) (title XVI).

 Even if Dotson could maintain such an argument, we would be inclined to reject it because the Secretary's classification
seems rationally to further the legitimate interest of rewarding those persons with a prior attachment to the work
force who have contributed to the Social Security system.

Dotson's argument would become relevant in two situations, the first of which is beyond the court's powers generally
and the second of which is not implicated in this appeal. The first scenario involves a wealthy addict who is able to
satisfy his or her addiction without resort to the welfare system. Such a person, of course, is better off than Dotson,
but this disparity yields him no cause of action. In the second scenario, a wealthy addict who is not engaging in SGA,
but who has paid into the Social Security system, applies for and receives OASDI benefits. This person, again undoubtedly
better off than Dotson, presumably would be ineligible for SSI benefits due to an excess of resources and income. See
generally note 6, 
supra. 
Importantly, however, Dotson is not in a position to make this argument because the ALJ below did not deny him benefits
based on his income or resources, but rather based on the fact that Dotson was engaging in SGA.

The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
