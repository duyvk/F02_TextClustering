Firefighters have doused flames at a dump in Hagersville, Canada, where 14 
million tires have been burning for more than two weeks, forcing hundreds of 
residents to evacuate the smoky fumes.

"The fire isn't officially out yet, but there's no longer any flames or 
billowing smoke," Ontario Environment Ministry spokesman Gerry Merchant said. 
Workers have started going over the dump, which covers about 11 acres, looking 
for hot spots hidden in the remains of the burned tires at the Tyre King 
Recycling dump, about 150 miles east of Detroit. The tire dump, Ontario's 
largest, was declared an illegal waste site in 1985. The fire is believed to 
have been set by an arsonist.
