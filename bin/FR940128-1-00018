1. Hazard Analysis 
The first step in the establishment of an HACCP system for a food process is the identification of the hazards associated
with the product. NACMCF defined a hazard as a biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be
unsafe for consumption (Ref. 34, p. 186). The hazard analysis step should include an assessment of both the likelihood
that these hazards will occur and their severity if they do occur. It should also involve the establishment of preventive
measures to control them. To be addressed by the HACCP system, the hazards must be such, according to NACMCF, that their
prevention, elimination, or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the production of a safe food. Even factors
beyond the immediate control of the processor, such as how the food will be distributed and how it will be consumed,
must be considered because these factors could influence how it should be processed. Hazards that involve low risk
and that are not likely to occur need not be considered for purposes of HACCP.
NACMCF has developed numerous issues to be considered during hazard analysis. These issues relate to matters such
as ingredients, processing, distribution, and the ultimate intended use of the product. FDA urges seafood processors
and importers to become familiar with these issues. They include, for example, whether a food contains any sensitive
ingredients that may present microbiological hazards, chemical hazards, or physical hazards; whether sanitation
practices can affect the safety of the food that is being processed; and whether the finished food will be heated by
the consumer. For seafood, this analysis is particularly important because it is consumed raw or partially cooked
to an extent unrivaled for other flesh foods. Examples of seafoods that are consumed in this way include raw molluscan
shellfish, sushi, steamed clams, and cold smoked salmon.
2. Identify the Critical Control Points in the Process
Points in a manufacturing process that may be critical control points, as listed by the NACMCF, include cooking, chilling,
specific sanitation procedures, product formulation control, prevention of cross contamination, and certain
aspects of employee and environmental hygiene. For example, a cooking step that must be operated at a specific temperature
and for a specified time in order to destroy microbiological pathogens is a critical control point. Likewise, refrigeration
required to prevent hazardous microorganisms from multiplying or toxins from forming is a critical control point.
3. Establish Critical Limits for Preventive Measures Associated With Each Identified Critical Control Point 
In essence, this step involves establishing a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with
a critical control point. Critical limits can be thought of as boundaries of safety for each critical control point
and may be set for preventive measures such as temperature, time, physical dimensions, moisture level, water activity,
Ph, available chlorine, or sensory information such as texture, aroma, or visual appearance. Critical limits may
be derived from sources such as regulatory standards and guidelines, literature surveys, experimental studies,
and experts. 
4. Establish Procedures To Monitor Critical Control Points
Monitoring is a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether a critical control point is under
control and to produce an accurate record for future use in verification. NACMCF identifies three main purposes for
monitoring: (1) It tracks the system's operation so that a trend toward a loss of control can be recognized, and corrective
action can be taken to bring the process back into control before a deviation occurs; (2) it indicates when loss of control
and a deviation has actually occurred, and corrective action must be taken; and (3) it provides written documentation
for use in verification of the HACCP plan. 
As NACMCF points out, continuous monitoring is possible with many types of physical and chemical methods. For example,
temperature and time for a scheduled thermal process can be recorded continuously on temperature-recording charts.
When it is not possible to monitor a critical limit on a continuous basis, monitoring intervals must be reliable enough
to permit the manufacturer to determine whether the hazard is under control. 
5. Establish the Corrective Action To Be Taken When Monitoring Shows That a Critical Limit Has Been Exceeded 
While the HACCP system is intended to prevent deviations in a planned process from occurring, perfection is rarely,
if ever, achievable. Thus, NACMCF states that there must be a corrective action plan in place to: (1) Determine the
disposition of any food that was produced when a deviation was occurring; (2) fix or correct the cause of noncompliance
to ensure that the critical control point is under control; and (3) maintain records of corrective actions. 
6. Establish Effective Recordkeeping Systems That Document the HACCP System 
This principle requires the preparation and maintenance of a written HACCP plan that sets out the hazards, critical
control points, and critical limits identified by the firm, as well as the monitoring, recordkeeping, and other procedures
that the firm intends to take to implement the plan. Secondly, this principle requires the maintenance of records
generated during the operation of the plan. 
Ultimately, it is the recordkeeping associated with HACCP procedures that makes the system work, both from the standpoint
of the HACCP operator (industry) and the regulator. One conclusion in a study of HACCP performed by the Department
of Commerce is that correcting problems without recordkeeping almost guarantees that problems will reoccur (Ref.
35, p. 85). The requirement to record events at critical control points on a regular basis ensures that preventive
monitoring is occurring in a systematic way.
