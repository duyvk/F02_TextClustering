  [Text] The University of Lagos has been closed down. A 
statement by the registrar, Dr. A.A. Omortoshor, directs all 
students to vacate the premises immediately. The statement says 
that the senate at its meeting yesterday reviewed recent events 
on campus which resulted in arson and general breakdown of law 
and order in pursuit of alleged cult activity. According to the 
statement, while the senate condemns all secret cult activities 
on campus, it cannot condone acts of hooliganism and lawlessness.
