 Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security

Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors,

on case decisions made at all administrative levels of adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions,
opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy interpretations of the law and regulations.
Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all
components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon
as precedents in adjudicating other cases. 
If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the 
Federal Register
 to that effect.

Policy Interpretation Ruling
Title XVI: Workers' Compensation (WC) Payments 
Purpose:
 To clarify that, under the supplemental security income (SSI) program, any portion of a WC payment designated for
medical expenses, or for legal or other expenses attributable to obtaining the WC award is not income. 
Citations (Authority):
 Section 1612(a)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act (SSACT), as amended; Regulations No. 16, sections 416.1103(a),
416.1121(a), and 416.1123(b)(3) 
Pertinent History: 
WC is awarded to an injured employee or to the survivor(s) of an employee under Federal and State WC programs and the
Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act. It may be paid by a Federal or State agency, an insurance company, or an employer.
Payments may include amounts for medical expenses, or for legal or other expenses attributable to obtaining the WC
award. These expenses may be past, current, or future and may be lump-sum or periodic in nature.
The SSACT at section 1612(a)(2)(B), and regulations at 
20 CFR 416.1121(a) provide that WC is unearned income for SSI purposes. Regulations at 20 CFR 416.1123(b)(3) provide
for counting less than the amount actually received when part of the amount received is for an expense of obtaining
the income. Regulations at 20 CFR 416.1103(a) provide that reimbursement for certain medical expenses is not income.
Policy Interpretation:
 If the Federal or State agency, insurance company, or employer that authorizes or makes a WC payment designates any
portion of it for medical expenses, or for legal or other expenses attributable to obtaining the WC award, such portion
is not income for SSI purposes. The expenses may be past, current, or future. Any portion of a WC award or payment not
designated for such expenses is unearned income. 
Effective Date:
 This Ruling merely clarifies longstanding SSI policy on the treatment of WC payments designated for certain types
of expenses. If a case comes to SSA's attention where SSA did not apply this policy, SSA will reopen and revise the earliest
determination possible under the rules of administrative finality. SSA will use the 2-year reopening rule, treating
the determination as an error on the face of the evidence.
