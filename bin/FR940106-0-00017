Summary of Comments
On August 2, 1993, the Technology Administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
Federal Register
 (55 FR 41069). In response to this notice forty-four letters were received; twenty-nine from universities, ten from
other not-for-profit research organizations and industry associations, one from a state agency, one from a U.S.-owned
for-profit company, one from a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned corporation, one from a member of the U.S. House
of Representatives, and one from a member of the NIST staff.
All but four of the forty-four respondents, including all twenty-nine from universities and all ten from other not-for-profit
organizations, commented on the proposed revision to the treatment of patent rights found in Sect.295.8. An additional
two dozen comments were received concerning proposed changes to the proposed definitions set out in Sect.295.2.
The remaining comments were scattered among several sections, including: five concerning new Sect.295.14, which
deals with special financial reporting requirements; three on the revisions to the selection criteria found in Sect.295.5;
two on the use of abbreviated proposals proposed in Sect.295.5; and one each on the provisions on the eligibility
and qualification of applicants found in Sect.Sect.295.3 and 295.31. No comments were received in response to
proposed changes to the following: Sect.295.1, pertaining to the purpose of the regulation; Sect.295.4, the selection
process; Sect.295.7, pertaining to notices of availability of funds; Sect.295.21, on qualification of applicants;
Sect.295.22, dealing with limitations on assistance; Sect.295.24, concerning registration under the antitrust
laws; and Sect.295.30, which describes the types of assistance available.
The following is a section-by-section description of the comments received by NIST, and NIST's response to those
comments.
Section 295.2 Definitions_Comment Summary (24 Comments)
Twenty-three respondents, all universities or other nonprofit organizations, questioned whether the definition
of "United States-owned company" found in Sect.295.2(r) of the proposed rule reflected the actual intent of Congress
as stated in the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991. The definition of United States-owned company set out
in Sect.295.2(r) is used in section 295.8 to determine eligibility to obtain title to inventions arising from assistance
under ATP. A consolidated analysis of the issues raised by Sect.295.2(r) and 295.8 is presented in the discussion
of Sect.295.8 later in this notice, and the reader is asked to refer to that discussion.
In addition to the issue described above, one respondent questioned the exclusion (by omission) of independent research
and development (IR&D) costs in the definition of matching funds found in Sect.295.2(1). IR&D funds are
generally generated through contracts funded by the federal government. The financial assistance regulations
which are applicable to ATP awards, and particularly Attachment E to OMB Circular A-110, prohibit the use of
federal funds as cost share or match unless specifically authorized by federal law. The rule follows closely the wording
of the 1988 legislation and hence cannot be changed without congressional action. The purpose of the limitations
on qualified matching funds is to obtain a meaningful and significant commitment of company resources towards ATP
objectives, including support to additional R&D beyond that which would have occurred without the ATP award.
Section 295.3 Eligibility of United States and foreign-owned businesses_(1 Comment)
One U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned company requested that both eligibility requirements and cancellation requirements
for foreign-owned applicants be made clearer and that they be consistent with present law and with H.R. 820. In response,
NIST notes that H.R. 820 is not law, but rather is pending legislation in the Congress. NIST cannot base changes in rules
upon proposed legislation that has not been enacted.
Section 295.5 Use of Abbreviated Proposals in the Selection Process_(2 Comments)
Two respondents endorsed the use of abbreviated proposals. One respondent further proposed that abbreviated proposals
address, and thus be evaluated on, scientific and technical criteria only. NIST has determined that business and
economic factors are important factors in assessing the potential for success of a proposed project, and therefore
must be considered in addition to the scientific and technical merit of the proposal.
Section 295.6 Criteria for Selection_(3 Comments)
Two respondents endorsed the increased emphasis on "scientific and technical merit", one of whom suggested increasing
its weight further to 40 percent. Another respondent took issue with the reduced weight for two proposers "level
of commitment" and suggested increasing the weight for the "commitment" criteria to 30 percent by eliminating
"experience and qualifications" as a separate criteria.
