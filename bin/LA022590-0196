SHUTTLE FLIGHT CALLED OFF JUST BEFORE LAUNCH;

The scheduled launch of the space shuttle Atlantis, already delayed three times 
by an astronaut's illness and foul weather, was scrubbed again early today with 
31 seconds left in the countdown when a problem developed in a ground computer. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineers raced against a six-minute clock -- the maximum time the flight 
could be delayed within the final seconds of the countdown -- in hopes that 
they could fix the malfunctioning computer, a range safety monitor that can 
destroy the shuttle if it strays too far off course and threatens populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Space agency officials said they were assessing whether the failed computer, 
and the weather, would permit a fifth launch try early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds before NASA engineers ran out of time, the delay in the countdown had 
caused temperatures in the shuttle's main engines to drop too low to permit 
launch, driving a final nail in plans to proceed with liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration workers had pumped 500,000 
gallons of fuel into Atlantis' external tank Saturday to ready the shuttle for 
flight. Once in orbit on a secret mission, the shuttle had been expected to put 
a photo-imaging spy satellite into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
A crew of five military astronauts was aboard Atlantis when the mission was 
scrubbed. It would have been the 34th flight of a U.S. space shuttle and the 
sixth shuttle flight entirely dedicated to a Defense Department mission. 
</P>
<P>
Commander John O. Creighton's scratchy throat and congestion had delayed the 
shuttle liftoff twice -- on Thursday and Friday mornings -- even as gusty winds 
and thunderstorms threatened to cause postponements. By Friday, NASA flight 
surgeons had cleared Creighton for flight, but torrential rains swept across 
Florida and grounded the shuttle on its launch pad for a third day in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the Apollo 13 mission of April, 1970, had an astronaut's illness 
delayed a launch. NASA officials said Creighton's illness was not "anywhere 
near significant enough" to prompt his replacement. But they added that the 
space agency no longer trains back-up crews and would have had to scramble to 
find a new commander for Atlantis had Creighton's illness been more serious. 
</P>
<P>
At Kennedy Space Center alone, each day's delay costs $247,000 in labor and 
materials, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Defense Department has shrouded Atlantis' payload in secrecy, experts 
said that the shuttle was to carry a $500-million satellite called the KH-12 
into space. The "keyhole" satellite would be the sixth in a constellation of 
U.S. craft designed to photograph and relay images of military and other 
installations, according to John Pike, a space expert with the Washington-based 
Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Gleaning information from the time and angle of the shuttle's launch, as well 
as from the rough weight of its payload, Pike and others are able to judge the 
purpose and capabilities of Atlantis' cargo. 
</P>
<P>
According to Aviation Week and Space Technology, an authoritative industry 
magazine, the 37,300-pound satellite also will carry eavesdropping equipment. 
</P>
<P>
From its projected orbit, the satellite is expected to come within photographic 
view of points as far north in the Soviet Union as Leningrad. In addition to 
helping monitor compliance to arms control agreements, such satellites would 
play a role in helping locate potential targets for nuclear attack.
