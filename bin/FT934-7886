LABOUR yesterday demanded urgent reform of corporate taxation and an
immediate cut in interest rates to rescue Britain from an economic crisis
caused by declining investment.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said continued low inflation and
faltering retail sales left Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, 'no economic
reason not to cut' rates.
Setting out Labour's pre-Budget document, Mr Brown said it was 'totally
wrong' for the chancellor to postpone a cut in rates until after the Budget.
He also urged the government to extend capital allowances for investment,
offer grants to help small businesses boost investment and develop new
technology, and set up a task force to accelerate private involvement in
infrastructure projects.
The document - Rebuilding Britain - sets out a 10-point plan to create jobs,
including the phased release of local authority capital receipts for
homebuilding and a one-year holiday from national insurance contributions
for employers recruiting the long-term unemployed.
Mr Brown said the government faced a choice between allowing the Budget to
continue the 'short-term stop-go economics of drift' and implementing
radical measures to boost investment.
Mr Andrew Smith, a shadow treasury minister, said there was a growing
consensus that tax on investment spending was not fair at the moment. He
said the government's refusal to allow tax relief for investment financed
from retained earnings had an impact on investment proposals equivalent to
up to 2 percentage points on interest rates.
Mr Smith called for the government to start urgent consultations on the tax
treatment of investment to establish a consensus on reform. Labour would
undertake a consultative review involving industry, commerce and
professional organisations to draw up options for government action.
He added: 'If a significant increase in productive and profitable business
investment could be secured by reform, as studies have suggested, every
effort must be made to bring it about . . . It is important that as wide as
possible a consensus is established on the best way ahead.'
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said government
attempts to involve private capital in infrastructure projects had been a
spectacular failure. She said 'a real sense of urgency' was required to
identify projects which were in the national interest.
