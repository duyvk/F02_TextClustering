SUMMARY 
                                 Russian President Boris Yeltsin is carrying out yet another 
reorganization of his presidential apparatus, this time clearly 
to help him expand presidential power vis-a-vis parliament and 
the cabinet.  The new constitution pushed through by Yeltsin 
after disbanding the Supreme Soviet gives the president more 
control over the cabinet and the rest of government, and the 
current reorganization is being justified by the need to expand 
his staff to exercise these expanded powers.  The strengthening 
of the president's apparatus and especially his analytical and 
policy making staff is important for the prospects for reform 
since with a unsympathetic parliament and a less reformist 
cabinet, reform policies more than ever depend on a strong 
president. 
                        END SUMMARY 
   Since December Yeltsin has been creating new agencies directly 
subordinate to the president, adding new assistants, expanding 
the Security Council structure, and now is preparing an edict to 
reorganize and strengthen his "Administration" (the presidential 
staff).  Although he has apparently not yet signed the edict, the 
reasons for the reorganization and its main features are being 
widely reported in the press.  Administration leaders have 
claimed that the main reason for the reorganization is that 
because of the president's increased powers under the new 
constitution, he requires a bigger staff to help him initiate 
policies and run more of the government.  Administration Leader 
Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS on 15 February that the additional 
presidential powers in the new constitution necessitate 
reorganization of the Administration and that a new economic 
analysis service, finance and budget directorate, and 
international department are being created to help the president 
stay "well informed" on the economy, budget, and tax policy. 
Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Administration's Directorate for 
Work with Territories and Presidential Representatives, also 
stated that the Administration was to be reorganized to bring it 
into line with the new constitution (Segodnya, 19 January). 
   Reports of an impending reorganization of the Administration 
began to appear in early January (Kuranty, 5 January; Georgiy 
Satarov to ITAR-TASS on 5 January; Segodnya, 6 January; Nikolay 
Medvedev to Segodnya, 19 January).  Filatov told ITAR-TASS on 21 
January that Yeltsin would probably sign a decree reorganizing 
the Administration the next week.  Over three weeks later, the 
decree had not appeared but he again told ITAR-TASS on 15 
February that Yeltsin would sign the decree in a few days.  On 19 
February he told Interfax that Yeltsin had the proposals for the 
reorganization on his desk. 
   Split Between Filatov and Ilyushin 
   The delay was apparently caused by disagreements over two rival 
plans presented by the two main groups in Yeltsin's personal 
staff--the Administration led by Filatov and Yeltsin's assistants 
and advisers led by First Assistant to the President Viktor 
Ilyushin.  Segodnya reported on 6 January that Filatov favored a 
plan worked out by his first deputy, Sergey Krasavchenko, which 
concentrated analysis in a single center in the Administration, 
while Ilyushin backed a plan worked out by members of the 
Presidential Council to expand the role of presidential 
assistants, giving them their own analytical staffs outside the 
Administration.  Moscow News (4-10 February) also reported that 
Filatov and Ilyushin were pushing rival plans and said that 
Yeltsin had not yet chosen which to accept.  Kommersant-Daily on 
10 February reported that a compromise plan had been worked out, 
making Ilyushin "for the first time officially equal in status" 
to Filatov and strengthening the group of personal assistants, 
but accepting most of Filatov's proposals regarding the 
Administration's structure (see box on "Reorganization of 
Administration").  News reports of the disagreements apparently 
prompted Filatov and Ilyushin to appear together on the 
television news program "Itogi" on 20 February to deny that there 
had been disagreements and to declare that they have "a joint, 
agreed on version" of the Administration reorganization, which 
divides functions between the Administration and assistants. 
This compromise arrangement would appear to heighten the 
potential for conflict between the already competing parallel 
structures of the Administration and staff of assistants by 
making them even more independent, rival power bases. 
   Other Recent Changes 
   Yeltsin's effort to strengthen presidential structures has been 
evident since December in the addition of more personal 
assistants to his staff, his assumption of control over more key 
government agencies, the creation of new organs under the 
president, and the strengthening of the Security Council's 
commission structure. 
   New Assistants 
   Yeltsin has added two new reform-minded assistants (pomoshchniki) 
to his present four, who were less involved in policy, at least 
publicly: 
   --He created a new post of national security assistant and named 
outspoken reformer Yuriy Baturin to it on 6 January (Ostankino 
TV, ITAR-TASS, 6 January).  Baturin explained to Interfax (7 
January) that he would coordinate the activities of the 
intelligence, counterintelligence, and other security services. 
He had joined Yeltsin's staff as an assistant on legal and 
political matters in June (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i 
Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 7 June 1993, page 2400) on 
condition that he could continue to speak out publicly (Novaya 
Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 7 July 1993). 
   --Sociologist Georgiy Satarov, who as a Presidential Council 
member has often voiced sharp opinions to newsmen, was named 
assistant to the president on 8 February (Russian TV, ITAR-TASS, 
8 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 9 February), and he explained in 
a 12 February Ostankino TV interview that he will handle 
presidential ties with the Federal Assembly and parties and 
public organizations and constitutional questions.  He has 
occasionally riled Yeltsin with his public remarks (See Note 1) 
and told Rossiyskiye Vesti (12 February) that he feels Yeltsin 
wants him to continue to speak out independently and offer 
differing opinions. 
   (Note 1)  In October, while Yeltsin was visiting Japan, Satarov 
suggested presidential elections be held simultaneous with 
parliamentary elections, undercutting Yeltsin's stand and 
prompting Yeltsin to publicly threaten to fire him (Obshchaya 
Gazeta, 15-21 October 1993). 
   Control Over Power Ministries 
   Yeltsin has assumed more control over some key cabinet ministries 
and other government agencies, clearly strengthening his power 
over the most sensitive security and communications agencies to 
protect himself against potential challenges.  His 10 January 
edict "On the Structure of Federal Organs of Executive Power" 
listed 10 agencies which henceforth will be "subordinate to the 
president of the Russian Federation on questions put under him by 
the Russian Federation Constitution or in accord with legislative 
acts of the Russian Federation":  the Ministries of Defense, 
Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs, the Main Directorate for 
Protection, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Agency 
for Government Communications and Information, the Federal Border 
Service, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Federal 
Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and the State 
Archive Service (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 January). 
   New Presidential Organs 
   In recent weeks Yeltsin has created a number of new organs 
directly under the president, expanding the already cumbersome 
structure run directly by the president.  In some cases it is not 
clear if they add to his political- power, but for some reason the 
president considered it necessary to put them under his direct 
control rather than under the cabinet or elsewhere in the 
government.  In addition to creating the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service and the Federal Border Service 
specifically under the president in mid and late December: 
   --On 31 December Yeltsin issued an edict creating a Judicial 
Chamber for Information Disputes (Sudebnaya Palata po 
Informatsionnym Sporam) under the president (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 
10 January), which apparently can be used to strengthen the 
president's control over the media.  According to ITAR-TASS, it 
will be able to decide matters such as allotment of radio and 
television coverage to the parliament and can warn media if they 
violate the Law on the Mass Media.  Chairman Anatoliy Vengerov 
said that the chamber will enforce constitutional provisions on 
information rights and assist the president in protecting freedom 
of the press (ITAR-TASS, 5 January).  The new constitution 
"guarantees the freedom of mass information" (article 29) and 
declares the president "the guarantor" of the constitution and 
the rights and freedoms of citizens (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 
December 1993). 
   --On 18 January Yeltsin created a new post for conducting his 
dealings with parliament--the president's plenipotentiary 
representative in the Federal Assembly (polnomochnyy predstavitel 
prezidenta v Federalnom Sobranii--Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 20 January) 
and named legal specialist Aleksandr M. Yakovlev to the post 
(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January). 
   --On 12 February Yeltsin created a "Directorate of the Federal 
State Service of the president" (Upravleniye Federalnoy 
Gosudarstvennoy Sluzhby Prezidenta) under his Cadre Policy 
Council (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 February).  It is to supervise 
the new civil service. 
   --On 16 February Yeltsin created a Public Chamber 
(Obshchestvennaya Palata) under the president.  Its statute calls 
it a "consultative organ" to provide feedback from the public to 
help in preparing presidential decisions and indicates it will be 
made up of representatives of parties, enterprises, religious 
denominations, trade unions, and other organizations.  It is to 
be "coordinated" by Yeltsin's personal assistant Lev Sukhanov 
(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 19 February).  It held its first meeting on 
19 February (ITAR-TASS, 19 February). 
   --On 17 February Yeltsin created a Committee for Information 
Technology Policy (Komitet po Politike Informatizatsii- 
-Roskominform) subordinate to the president and cabinet to 
oversee creation of federal computerization systems, along with 
the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information 
(ITAR-TASS, 19 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 23 February). 
   --On 25 February Yeltsin created an Expert Legal Council 
(Ekspertno-Pravovoy Sovet) under the president--another 
consultative, part-time body.  It will be chaired by State-Legal 
Directorate Chief Ruslan Orekhov and a Moscow lawyer, Igor 
Bezrukov (ITAR-TASS, 25 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 March). 
   Security Council Expansion 
   The president's Security Council, second only to the cabinet as a 
highlevel executive body, has become more active, with new 
commissions being formed under it and those created earlier being 
activated.  Although a 1 February Yeltsin edict (ITAR-TASS, 1 
February) dropped economic officials (the ministers of the 
economy and finance) in listing the new membership of the 
Security Council--appearing to remove economic questions from its 
purview--the expansion of the council's working commissions, 
including one on economic security, appears to broaden its 
activities, rather than reduce them.  A 3 March Kommersant-Daily 
article argued that the role of the Security Council may increase 
substantially since it is the best organ for Yeltsin to use to 
govern, given the independence of the cabinet under Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and the lack of a reformist majority in the 
Duma. 
   --An Interdepartmental Commission on Information Security was 
created by a Yeltsin decree on 18 December.  The new commission 
held its first meeting on 13 January and began working on its 
"main task"--working out state policy for information security 
(ITAR-TASS, 13 January). 
   --The council's Interdepartmental Commission for Defense Security 
held its first meeting on 29 December.  Its chairman is First 
Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and members include 
deputy ministers of the economy and internal affairs, deputy 
chief of staff, and the  border guards commander (ITAR-TASS, 29 
December). 
   --The first meeting of the council's Interdepartmental Commission 
on Economic Security was held on 10 January, under Chairman 
Andrey Zverev, concurrently head of the economic department of 
the cabinet (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11 January). 
   --The first meeting of the council's Interdepartmental Commission 
for Public Security was held on 18 January, chaired by Deputy 
Internal Affairs Minister Aleksandr Kulikov (ITAR-TASS, 18 
January). 
   --Yeltsin on 31 January signed an edict outlining the duties of 
the Security Council's Scientific Council--defining priorities 
for scientific research in the security sphere--and naming Vice 
President of the Academy of Sciences V. Purimov chairman (Mayak 
Radio, 31 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February).  Yeltsin had 
created the council with a 1 November decree (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 
3 February). 
   Implications 
   With a hostile parliament and a cabinet led by an apparently 
loyal but less reformist Premier Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin appears to 
be building up presidential structures that, aided by stronger 
presidential powers in the new constitution, will enable him to 
press reform policies on his own.  His expanding group of 
specialists, analysts, and policy-oriented assistants may enable 
him to develop more effective policies and establish better 
control over the government, more effectively competing with an 
assertive Duma or cabinet.  He has, however, reorganized his 
presidential structures before, for example, bringing Filatov in 
to strengthen his Administration in early 1993, and his staff's 
effectiveness still appears to leave something to be desired. 
Moreover, by perpetuating parallel structures--the Administration 
led by Filatov and the staff of assistants under Ilyushin--the 
new reorganization preserves great potential for competition and 
conflict within the presidential apparatus. 
   Box 
                Reorganization of the Administration 
   Although Yeltsin has apparently not yet signed an edict 
reorganizing the whole Administration, the features of such a 
reorganization have been described in accounts and charts 
published in Segodnya on 9 February and Kommersant-Daily and 
Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta on 10 February, and several edicts 
reorganizing parts of the Administration have already appeared 
(abolishing the Directorate for Information Resources in early 
February, creating a Finance-Budget Directorate on 28 February, 
and creating a Directorate for Information Supply on 3 March). 
According to these accounts, the new structure of the 
Administration aims to: 
   --Improve analysis by combining the present three analytical 
centers and a newly created "Situation Room" (Situationnaya 
Komnata) into one "Analytical Service" (Analiticheskaya Sluzhba), 
which will probably employ on a fulltime basis many of the 
present part-time presidential analysts (Kommersant-Daily, 10 
February).  According to the 6 January Segodnya, the poor 
performance of the present analytical centers during the December 
election--in analyzing voters' attitudes, predicting the outcome, 
and analyzing the results--was one of the reasons for the Filatov 
and Ilyushin reorganization proposals. 
   --Improve economic and foreign policy expertise, probably to make 
the president less dependent on the cabinet for advice on these 
issues.  The reorganization adds a "Service of Economic Analysis" 
(Sluzhba Ekonomicheskogo Analiza), a "Finance-Budget Directorate" 
(Finansovo-Byudzhetnoye Upravleniye), and an "International 
Department" (Mezhdunarodnyy Otdel).

reorganization.  (See the Trends of 24 March 1993, pages 6-15.) 
   2 Based on the 10 February Kommersant-Daily and Novaya 
Yezhednevnaya Gazeta accounts and charts. (This structure is 
provisional since it has not yet been confirmed by Yeltsin.) 
   3 On 10 February Andrey Voykov was appointed head of the State 
Duma's apparatus by the Duma's council (ITAR-TASS, 11 February). 
Yeltsin relieved him of his Administration post on 22 February 
(ITAR-TASS, 22 February). 
   4 A Finansovo-Byudzhetnoye Upravleniye was created by a 28 
February Yeltsin edict, with Igor Moskovskiy as head and with 30 
employees (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 March).  It is to supply the 
president with information, analysis, and recommendations on 
questions of finances, budget, insurance, prices, credits, and 
money (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). 
   5 The Upravleniye Informatsionnykh Resursov was abolished and its 
remnants transferred to the Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and Information under the president (Segodnya, 9 
February; Kommersant-Daily, 10 February; Radio Rossii, 21 
February).  Yeltsin fired Vasiliy Kupriyanovskiy as head of the 
directorate for "critical failure in performing his duties" 
(ITAR-TASS, 22 February).  A 24 February Izvestiya article on the 
abolition of the directorate suggests that the communications 
agency had pushed this move to eliminate a competing information 
center.  According to the article, the directorate disseminated 
information to localities using a modern computer system and now 
the agency will control this system. 
   6 Yeltsin signed a 3 March edict creating a Directorate for 
Supply of Information and named Petr Filippov (head of the 
present Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy) to head it 
(ITAR-TASS, 4 March).  With 40 employees, it is to work with the 
press and television and analyze information coming from regions, 
according to a 3 March Moskovskiy Komsomolets article. 
   7 The Kontrolno-Nablyudatelnyy Sovet that operated directly under 
Administration Leader Filatov is not included in the wiring 
diagrams in Kommersant-Daily and Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta and 
apparently will disappear. 
   8 Ilyushenko told Izvestiya (15 February) that the Kontrolnoye 
Upravleniye's work was to monitor activities of central and local 
officials and report wrongdoing to the president.  On 26 February 
Yeltsin removed Ilyushenko and nominated him for prosecutor 
general (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 1 March). 
   9 The president's representatives-in oblasts are dropped from the 
title of the Directorate for Work with Territories and 
Presidential Representatives and placed directly under the 
president along with presidential assistants, according to the 
Kommersant-Daily and Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta wiring diagrams. 
   10 Upravleniye Delami. 
   11 The Upravleniye Deloproizvodstva sends out presidential edicts 
and handles the mail, according to a 6 March 1993 Nezavisimaya
