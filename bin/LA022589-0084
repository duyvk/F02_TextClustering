A blizzard battered the East Coast with wind and snow Friday, lashing the sea 
into 30-foot waves, and the Deep South shivered with unaccustomed temperatures 
in the teens that iced highways and froze early spring blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures dropped to record lows for the date in 35 cities from the Great 
Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico as arctic air surged south. Miami posted a record 
low of 37, equaling the temperature Friday in Minot, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
Slippery roads were blamed for hundreds of accidents, and schools were closed 
from Georgia to New Jersey. Three weather-related deaths were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"All the roads are covered; we've got ice, and people are wrecking right and 
left," said Officer Dennis Anders of the Alleghany County, N.C., Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The storm dumped 12 inches of snow in southeastern Virginia, and winds gusted 
to 60 m.p.h., said Terry Ritter, chief meteorologist for the National Weather 
Service in Norfolk. He said it was the region's first storm classified as a 
blizzard since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The winds generated waves up to 12 feet on Chesapeake Bay, and 30-foot waves 
were reported on the Atlantic Ocean, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy cut back on all but essential services and delayed the departure of 
seven Norfolk-based ships that had been scheduled to sail Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is visibility. There is none," said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a 
spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The snowstorm formed as a low pressure system off the coast of the Carolinas. 
The storm center, spinning counterclockwise, raked its wind across the coast 
out of the northeast, earning it the label of a "nor'easter." 
</P>
<P>
Winds gusted to 59 m.p.h. near Cape Hatteras, N.C., and the state shut down six 
of the seven ferries it operates along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Blizzard conditions were reported along the Outer Banks islands and in North 
Carolina's Gates and Hertford counties, where 18 inches of snow and drifts to 3 
feet were reported, weather service officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Roads through North Carolina were covered with snow; up to 11 inches fell in 
parts of eastern Virginia, and drifts 4 feet high were reported in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures fell into the teens across parts of Mississippi, Alabama and 
Georgia -- just a week after record highs in the 70s and 80s brought peach 
trees and daffodils into premature bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Record lows Friday included 16 degrees in Birmingham, Ala.; 19 in Mobile, Ala.; 
23 in Baton Rouge, La., and 28 at New Orleans. Atlanta tied its record of 17. 
Grand Rapids, Mich., hit a record 9 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
Shelters in Birmingham opened for people needing a warm place for the night. 
"Anyone can come is as long as they don't cause problems," police community 
service officer Alton Morgado said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold was especially noticeable to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably warmer in New York," Kristin Horne, 28, said in Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla. "I didn't bring any warm clothes to Florida. We couldn't even go to the 
beach today." 
</P>
<P>
The cold also threatened some crops in the South. 
</P>
<P>
At Plant City in central Florida, where a strawberry festival is planned to 
open March 2, farmers worked to shield their plants. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how your stomach feels when you think you could lose everything you 
worked for? That's the feeling we're getting now," said Tommy Brock, whose 
fields are east of Plant City. 
</P>
<P>
Peach growers in Alabama burned tires and coal in orchards during the night to 
protect trees against the cold, but there were scattered reports of damage.
