FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: GDP growth forecast lifted to 1 3/4% for 1993;
inflation to rise and fall again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This section explains in detail recent developments in the economy and its
short-term prospects.
G7 growth slowed in the first half of 1993 and is forecast to be only 1 per
cent in the year as a whole. Faster, but still modest, growth is projected
for 1994. Inflation in the major countries is forecast to continue falling.
In the UK, growth has been stronger than expected at the time of the March
Budget and is now forecast at 1 3/4 per cent in 1993. The 1994 forecast is a
rise in GDP of 2 1/2 per cent, slightly below the average of the forecasts
from the Panel of Independent Forecasters.
Underlying RPI inflation has been lower than forecast in the March Budget.
It is likely to rise in the first half of 1994 because of the short-run
impact of tax changes. But it is forecast to remain within the Government's
1 to 4 per cent target range and to fall back to 3 1/4 per cent by the end
of the year. The average forecast from the Independent Panel is marginally
lower.
Unemployment has fallen 137,000 since the beginning of the year and is now
below 2.9m, a much better outcome than generally expected.
The current account deficit in 1992 has been revised down to Pounds 8 1/2
bn, with the invisible surplus stronger than in recent years. Despite a
fallback in the invisible surplus and stronger growth in the UK than in
continental Europe, our main export market, the current account deficit is
expected to increase only slightly in 1993. It is forecast to be Pounds 9
1/2 bn in both 1993 and 1994.
The sterling index has been fairly steady this year. Long-term interest
rates have fallen significantly reflecting lower inflation expectations.
The PSBR in the current financial year is expected to be very close to the
Pounds 50bn forecast in March. As a result of Budget measures and economic
recovery it is forecast to fall to Pounds 38bn in 1994-95.
The forecast is based on the conventional assumption that sterling remains
close to recent levels. Oil prices are assumed to average Dollars 17 a
barrel.
World economy
The pick-up in world economic growth most forecasters were predicting at the
time of the March Budget has been slow to materialise. Growth in the US in
the first half of the year was less than forecast, though it seems to have
recovered strongly in the second half. Japanese GDP and industrial
production fell again in the second quarter. And although activity in
continental Europe may have stabilised there are few clear signs of
recovery; confidence remains low in most European countries.
For the major seven countries (G7) as a whole, industrial production stopped
falling towards the end of 1992, but there has been little recovery yet;
weakness in Japan and continental Europe has largely offset rises in the US.
GDP growth in the G7 between the second half of 1992 and the first half of
1993 slowed to under 1 per cent at an annual rate, compared with growth of 1
3/4 per cent in 1992.
Against this background, policy has remained expansionary in the US, and
there has been a steady easing in continental Europe and Japan. US
short-term interest rates have been around 3 per cent for over a year,
consistent with a real interest rate close to zero. In Japan the official
discount rate has been cut to a record low of 1 3/4 per cent, and the
government has introduced a further stimulatory fiscal package - the third
in just over a year. In continental Europe, however, despite cuts in nominal
rates, real interest rates remain higher than usual at a cyclical trough.
Fiscal deficits in Europe have risen sharply, partly because of the
recession.
Weak activity in the major countries has kept non-oil commodity prices close
to their lowest level in real terms since the early 1970s. The Brent oil
price has fallen since the spring, dropping below Dollars 15 a barrel
towards the end of November, compared with over Dollars 18 in the first half
of the year. It has averaged just under Dollars 16 1/2 a barrel in the last
three months and is assumed to average Dollars 17 a barrel during the
forecast period.
Low commodity prices have contributed to a continued easing of inflationary
pressure in the major countries. Since the beginning of the year consumer
price inflation has fallen  3/4 per cent in Germany and  1/2 per cent in the
US, and has been steady at historically low levels in France and Italy. In
Japan, inflation fell below 1 per cent in the early summer before rising
again as poor weather temporarily boosted food prices. Weak inflationary
pressures and falling inflation expectations have contributed to a rally in
world bond markets, taking long-term interest rates down to their lowest
levels since the late 1960s.
GDP growth in the G7 is forecast to be 1 per cent in 1993. This is  1/2
percentage point below the March Budget forecast, reflecting weaker than
expected activity in the first half of the year and only patchy signs of
recovery in the second half. Growth is forecast to rise to 2 per cent in
1994, but with recovery still some way off in Japan and continental Europe,
marked differences between the growth rates of individual countries are
likely to persist.
In the US, growth of around 2 3/4 per cent is forecast for 1993 and 1994,
close to the rate in 1992. This continues the pattern of fairly modest
recovery since the trough in early 1991. Following substantial upward
revisions to past GDP data, the recent US recession looks to have been one
of the shallowest since the war, implying less scope for the very rapid
growth rates recorded in previous recoveries.
In Japan, GDP is now forecast to fall by  1/4 per cent in 1993. This would
be the first annual fall since 1974. Although last year's fiscal package is
beginning to provide a boost to public sector demand, private demand has
been much weaker than expected. With the high yen now likely to restrain
export volumes, growth is forecast to be only 1 per cent in 1994.
GDP in western Germany may be levelling out, at around 2 1/2 per cent below
its early 1992 peak. But prospective tax increases and the deterioration in
competitiveness over the past two years are expected to hold back recovery
next year. Although output in the east continues to rise, growth in Germany
as a whole is forecast to be only  3/4 per cent in 1994, following a fall in
output of 1 1/2 per cent this year.
GDP in the European Community is forecast to fall by  1/2 per cent in 1993,
and recover by only 1 1/4 per cent in 1994, similar to the recent Commission
forecast. EC unemployment has risen from 8 1/2 per cent in 1990 to 10 3/4 .
Growth in 1994 is unlikely to be sufficient to prevent further increases in
unemployment over the next year.
Low commodity prices and spare capacity in G7 countries should continue to
exert downward pressure on inflation. Consumer price inflation in the G7 is
forecast to fall from its current level of 2 3/4 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent
by the fourth quarter of 1994 and 2 1/4 per cent by mid-1995. The largest
fall is likely to be in Germany where inflation - currently second highest
in the G7 - is forecast to be below 2 1/2 per cent by the first half of
1995.
Growth of world trade in manufactures is forecast to slow from 5 per cent in
1992 to 2 3/4 per cent in 1993, as a result of the slowdown in continental
Europe and Japan. Growth elsewhere in East Asia and in Latin American
countries has remained buoyant, and imports to the US have been surprisingly
strong. But in Europe - the UK's main export market - weak domestic demand
appears to have depressed imports severely (although trade volumes may have
been distorted by the introduction of Intrastat, the new system for
recording intra-European Community trade). As a result, UK export markets
are forecast to grow by only 1 1/4 per cent this year, 1 1/2 percentage
points less than world trade. With faster growth in the industrialised
countries, growth of world trade is forecast to be stronger in 1994 than in
1993, at around 5 1/4 per cent. Growth of UK export markets is also expected
to increase but to remain below that of world trade.
UK demand and output
As a result of the rebasing of the national accounts to 1990 prices and
other data revisions, the trough in GDP is now estimated to have occurred in
the first quarter of 1992. During the recession non-oil GDP fell by 3 3/4
per cent, rather less than the 5 1/4 per cent fall in the early 1980s
recession.
The recovery has proceeded fairly steadily so far, with an uninterrupted
expansion in GDP of 2 1/2 per cent over the six quarters to the third
quarter of 1993. Output has risen in most sectors. North Sea oil and gas
output has risen particularly strongly, the fruit of heavy investment in
recent years. Output has increased by about 2 1/2 per cent in both
manufacturing and services, and service sector output is now above the level
seen at the peak of the cycle.
The impetus to recovery has come mainly from consumer spending and exports.
Since the trough in output, consumer spending has contributed 2 per cent to
the growth in GDP and exports 1 3/4 per cent. Stocks too made some initial
contribution. During 1992 the positive contribution of exports was more than
offset by rising imports, but this year exports have accelerated, despite
weak demand in continental Europe, and import growth has fallen. Some
improvement in trade performance was to be expected in the wake of gains in
competitiveness, but its extent is uncertain given the change in the way
intra-European Community trade has been recorded since the turn of the year.
While the recovery so far has been remarkably smooth, it would not be
surprising if the profile of output were more uneven from now on.
Nevertheless growth is expected to continue in the final quarter of 1993.
Although growth in manufacturing output appeared to falter over the summer,
business surveys point to resumed expansion, albeit at a modest pace. North
Sea output is rising and there is little sign of a break in the upward trend
in consumer demand, much of which is reflected in higher output in the
service sector. So GDP growth in 1993 is now forecast to be 1 3/4 per cent,
a stronger performance than forecast in the March Budget.
Faster growth is forecast for 1994, with GDP increasing by 2 1/2 per cent, 2
1/4 per cent excluding North Sea oil. This acceleration largely reflects a
pick-up in business spending: improved company finances and modest increases
in capacity utilisation should boost spending on fixed assets and stocks.
Export growth should increase a little as continental Europe recovers,
although imports are forecast to grow more strongly too. Annual growth in
non-oil GDP is forecast to be slightly stronger again in the first half of
1995, but with growth of North Sea output slowing, total GDP growth is
forecast to remain at 2 1/2 per cent.
Personal sector and the housing market
Consumer spending started to recover in the second quarter of 1992, having
fallen 3 3/4 per cent in the recession. By the third quarter of 1993 most of
this fall had been reversed, with spending rising on average by  1/2 per
cent a quarter. The initial recovery followed a substantial fall in interest
rates and was accompanied by strong growth in real personal disposable
income. This year, however, growth of aggregate real incomes has weakened
and the saving ratio has fallen from 12 3/4 per cent in 1992 to an estimated
11 3/4 per cent in the first three quarters of the year. Weaker real income
growth is mainly the result of the slowdown in real average earnings growth
and smaller increases in dividend income following strong growth in 1992.
Events of the past 18 months have shown that consumer demand can recover
while the housing market remains weak. Even so, a stronger housing market
would help underpin the consumer recovery. The housing market has shown
signs of emerging from its slump, but both turnover and prices have moved
erratically in 1993. It is clear that the Autumn Statement package of
measures designed to take empty properties off the market played an
important role in the recovery of turnover in the early months of the year.
Indeed there was a small surge in housing starts in the spring as builders
sought to replace properties sold into the programme. While the early pace
of recovery was not sustained, with some weakening in the summer, activity
and prices in the third quarter were both well above their troughs.
With mortgage rates at their lowest levels since 1969 and house prices lower
in relation to incomes than since 1985, home ownership is more affordable
than for many years. Now that prices are rising, unemployment is falling and
there is a growing perception of more general recovery, increasing
confidence should lead to higher activity and prices in 1994.
Personal sector spending is likely to remain restrained by past standards,
given a desire for further balance sheet adjustment. Nevertheless there are
reasons for expecting a further decline in the saving ratio. Unemployment
has begun to fall, reducing the need for precautionary saving. Inflation is
forecast to remain low, reducing the need of households to save to maintain
the real value of their financial wealth, and lower interest rates have
eased the burden of household debt.
A decline in the saving ratio combined with continued growth in real
personal disposable income should permit consumption to increase in 1994 at
around its recent rate. Despite the tax increases due to take effect, real
personal disposable income could rise by 1 per cent in 1994, the same as in
1993, largely reflecting recoveries in self-employment and net investment
incomes. Numbers of self-employed in work have been increasing and net
investment income is being boosted by lower interest rates and high rates of
net accumulation of financial assets. In addition there is the prospect of
rising real income from wages and salaries before tax. Consumers'
expenditure is forecast to rise by 2 1/4 per cent in 1994, following an
increase of 2 per cent in 1993. Personal sector investment in dwellings -
which includes both new houses and improvements to existing houses - is
expected to grow faster than for several years as housing market activity
increases.
Although the saving ratio is forecast to fall and housing investment to
rise, the personal sector financial balance is projected to remain in
sizeable surplus in 1994 - around 6 per cent of personal disposable income.
The debt/income ratio has fallen over the past couple of years. And with
interest payments falling sharply as a result of lower interest rates, the
burden of debt is much reduced.
Corporate sector and investment
Following concerted efforts to cut costs, the corporate sector has now begun
to reap the benefits. Having been more or less static through the recession,
industrial and commercial companies' (ICCs) profits in the first three
quarters of 1993 were 14 per cent up on a year earlier. With sharply reduced
short-term interest payments, down a quarter, and further reductions in tax
payments, company saving (undistributed income) is estimated to have risen
by about a third over the same period.
Profitability, as measured by the real rate of return, is expected to be
well up in 1993 on its 1992 level. In 1994 it is forecast to pick up further
as recovery strengthens, labour costs remain in check, and pressure on
margins eases further. Despite higher tax payments in 1994, higher profits
are expected to carry through into a further marked increase in company
saving.
Business investment in the first three quarters of 1993 was 1 3/4 per cent
down on a year earlier, although manufacturing investment rose slightly and
North Sea investment increased by 7 per cent. But at its projected trough in
the second half of 1993, business investment as a share of GDP is still
above the levels seen between 1970 and the mid-1980s.
Investment intentions have improved over the past year, and are now pointing
to modest growth in manufacturing investment over the year ahead. Moreover
the improvement in companies' profitability and balance sheets will ease
constraints on investment. The degree of spare capacity will, on the other
hand, continue to be a restraining influence until recovery is further
advanced. Business investment is forecast to rise by 3 3/4 per cent in 1994
and by 4 1/2 per cent in the year to the first half of 1995.
General government investment in fixed assets rose 8 1/4 per cent in volume
terms in 1992, and is projected to rise by a further 11 3/4 per cent in
1993, in part due to the temporary relaxation of the rules for spending out
of local authority capital receipts. In 1994 it is forecast to fall 3 per
cent, as this temporary measure unwinds. But government investment is
projected to remain at historically high levels.
Fixed investment in the economy as a whole is forecast to grow by  1/2 per
cent in 1993 and by 3 per cent in 1994, reflecting the forecast pick-up in
business and housing investment which more than compensates for lower
general government investment.
Typically stockbuilding makes a positive contribution to growth during
periods of economic upswing. The slowdown in the rate of destocking in 1992
contributed  3/4 per cent to GDP growth, following three years when the
stock cycle made a negative contribution. But this year, with destocking
continuing at much the same rate as in 1992, stocks are expected to make
only a small contribution to growth. Stocks are forecast to contribute  1/2
per cent to growth in 1994 as stockbuilding resumes.
Latest information suggests that ICCs moved into small financial surplus in
the first three quarters of 1993, for the first time since 1987. The
expected buoyancy of company saving and relatively modest growth of capital
spending imply a larger financial surplus in 1994. This would partly restore
the damage done to company balance sheets by the substantial deficits
incurred in the five years to 1992, and particularly in 1989 and 1990.
Labour market
Employment rose between March and June 1993, for the first time in three
years. The fall in employment during the recession was partly associated
with a productivity performance which was abnormally strong for a cyclical
downturn, perhaps reflecting the effects of labour market reforms. Although
the recent turnround in employment was accompanied by a slowdown in
productivity growth, non-oil productivity in the second quarter of 1993 was
still 3 3/4 per cent up on a year earlier, and manufacturing productivity in
the third quarter was 5 per cent up. As the recovery becomes more
established, annual productivity growth could fall further from its recent
high rates.
Unemployment rose by 1.4m between April 1990 and its peak in January 1993 -
considerably less than the fall in employment. But by October 1993 it had
fallen 137,000. This is a much better performance than expected by most at
the time of the March Budget.
Trade and the balance of payments
The introduction from 1 January of a new system for recording visible trade
with the European Community - Intrastat - has made it extremely difficult to
interpret recent trade performance. Not only have the figures recorded in
the first few months of the new system been more liable to revision than
usual, but some of the movements - such as sharply divergent changes in
imports from the European Community and from elsewhere - are difficult to
explain. Due to the new method of collection there may well have been a
break in the European Community trade figures at the start of the year,
implying that year-on-year growth rates in 1993 are unreliable. Part of the
problem may lie with the split of values into prices and volumes. As the new
system settles down, however, shorter period movements should become more
reliable. In the meantime the forecast gives more weight to the fundamental
influences on trade performance than to recent outturns.
The main influences on actual trade flows over the next year or so are the
improvement in competitiveness already achieved and the cyclical position in
the UK compared with elsewhere. Cost competitiveness so far in 1993 has
turned out much as expected. Unit labour cost performance in the UK has been
unusually good. In 1993 as a whole, unit labour costs in manufacturing could
be 1 per cent lower than in 1992, and they are forecast to remain unchanged
in 1994. By contrast competitors' unit labour costs have been rising and are
expected to continue to rise. Cost competitiveness, after allowing for
exchange rate changes, was probably around 20 per cent better in the third
quarter of 1993 than a year earlier, and is forecast to remain close to that
level during 1994. On the recorded figures export price competitiveness has
improved much less. This may partly reflect exporters taking the opportunity
of the lower exchange rate to widen profit margins which had previously been
squeezed, but it is also possible that the recorded increase in export
prices is too high.
The recorded figures for imports so far this year are lower than past
experience would have suggested. Although the effect of the improvement in
competitiveness may have been stronger than in the past, it is possible that
the import volume figures in 1993 are understated by comparison with the
figures for earlier years. The sharp fall in imports from the European
Community is particularly difficult to understand against a background of
little change in imports from elsewhere. Recorded non-oil import volume
growth may be only 2 1/2 per cent in 1993, following a rise of 7 per cent in
1992.
The forecast assumes that the usual relationships between the growth of
imports, domestic demand, and competitiveness are re-established from now
on. These point to UK imports growing faster than UK domestic demand,
reflecting the progressive specialisation of world production. Increased
specialisation is evident in the consistently higher rates of growth for
measures of world trade than for measures of world demand and output.
Although improved competitiveness will be a moderating influence on import
growth, its effect is unlikely to be strong enough to bring underlying
import growth below domestic demand growth. Non-oil imports are forecast to
increase by 5 3/4 per cent in 1994.
The sustained improvement in competitiveness will help UK exporters to
increase their market penetration. But overseas demand is itself weak. UK
export markets may grow by only a little more than 1 per cent in 1993
because of the particular weakness of demand in continental Europe. In 1994,
however, UK export markets are forecast to rise 4 per cent. Recorded non-oil
exports may be around 3 1/2 per cent higher in volume terms in 1993 than in
1992. But the statistical problems discussed earlier may have reduced
recorded export growth - actual growth may have been somewhat stronger. In
1994 non-oil export growth is forecast to be around 5 1/4 per cent.
Recorded prices for both exports and imports have moved erratically in 1993,
with no clear trends. Non-oil import prices have risen about 10 per cent in
the year to the third quarter, less than exchange rate and world price
changes would imply. This may be because importers are finding it difficult
to pass on the exchange rate effects fully in the face of low consumer and
producer price inflation in the UK. Non-oil export prices have also risen 10
per cent - again a good deal slower than world prices measured in sterling.
Comparing 1993 as a whole with 1992, the terms of trade, as recorded, may
improve by around 1 1/4 per cent, recovering from their sharp fall in the
immediate aftermath of last year's devaluation. Little change is expected in
1994.
North Sea output rose 8 per cent in 1992 and it has risen even faster during
1993. In 1993 as a whole, output is expected to be around 15 per cent higher
than in 1992, with a further rise of nearly 20 per cent forecast in 1994.
Oil output is expected to be in the upper half of the 1993 Brown Book range.
Gas output, which has increased strongly this year, is forecast to rise
further. As a consequence of higher production, the surplus on trade in oil
is forecast to rise to Pounds 4bn in 1994, its highest since 1987.
The surplus on invisibles in 1992 was Pounds 5bn well above early estimates.
The surplus on net interest, profits and dividends (IPD) was particularly
strong in the second half of the year, at Pounds 4bn, compared with under
Pounds 2bn in the first half. But much of the increase probably resulted
from abnormally high activity in the foreign exchange markets around the
time of last year's ERM crisis. High IPD surpluses have not been sustained
in the first half of 1993. And the balance of transfers - consisting largely
of net transfers to the European Community and aid and other government
spending overseas - has continued to deteriorate.
The balance on services, on the other hand, which was depressed by insurance
claims relating to Hurricane Andrew in the second half of 1992, rebounded
strongly in the first half of 1993. It should also benefit from the
improvement in competitiveness. Exports of services are forecast to rise by
4 per cent in volume terms in 1994, slightly more than in 1993. Imports of
services could grow by 4 3/4 per cent in 1994 following a small fall in
1993. But an increase in the services balance is unlikely to be sufficient
to offset the deterioration in IPD and transfers. Overall the surplus on
invisibles is projected to be Pounds 2bn in 1993, well down on the previous
year. It is forecast to fall a little further in 1994.
The current account deficit in 1992 has been revised down to Pounds 8 1/2 bn
from Pounds 12bn estimated at the time of the March Budget. The deficit is
forecast to widen slightly to Pounds 9 1/2 bn in 1993, with a fall in the
invisible surplus partly offset by a smaller visible deficit, and to remain
at that level in 1994.
Inflation
Both cost and price inflation have been significantly lower during 1993 than
forecast a year ago and in the March Budget. Despite the depreciation of
sterling, underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage
interest payments (MIPs), is expected to be lower at the end of 1993 than at
the end of 1992. There are clearly considerable domestic disinflationary
pressures.
Underlying average earnings growth was 3 per cent in September, down from 5
1/2 per cent a year earlier. Pay settlements have also continued to fall.
Latest data from the CBI show the average of settlements in manufacturing
and services at about 2 1/2 per cent in the third quarter, compared to over
4 per cent a year earlier. On its own, this would point to further falls in
earnings growth because settlements take time to feed through fully. On the
other hand, there may be some upward pressure on earnings as profits
increase and labour markets become less slack.
Falling earnings growth combined with strong productivity growth has led to
exceptionally good unit wage cost performance this year. Unit wage costs in
manufacturing were  1/2 per cent lower than a year earlier in the third
quarter, and in the year as a whole are forecast to be around 1 per cent
lower than in 1992. In the private sector, unit wage costs are forecast to
increase only marginally between 1992 and 1993.
Falling unit wage costs in large part explain why producer prices have
remained unexpectedly subdued, despite higher import prices and some
rebuilding of profit margins. Producer output price inflation rose to 3.2
per cent in October, from a low point of 2.0 per cent in the autumn of 1992.
Producer input prices had shown more of an impact from import prices earlier
this year. But in the year to October they increased by only 1.0 per cent,
further evidence of a squeeze on importers' margins.
Producer output price inflation is forecast to be 3 1/4 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1993. It may then rise a little, as manufacturers continue
to rebuild margins against the background of less favourable movements in
unit wage costs and adjustment to higher import prices. But as these factors
run their course, producer output price inflation is forecast to fall back
to 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1994 and 2 3/4 per cent by mid-1995.
Underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding MIPs, fell to 2.8 per
cent in early summer; its lowest rate since 1968. It rose subsequently, but
this was fully reversed by a sharp fall back to 2.8 per cent in October.
Underlying inflation is forecast to rise somewhat during the first half of
1994, while remaining within the Government's 1 to 4 per cent target range,
before falling back to 3 1/4 per cent by the end of the year. This temporary
increase in underlying inflation reflects the short-run impact of tax
changes. Over-indexation of excise duties, the new taxes in the Budget, and
the first tranche of VAT on domestic fuel and power announced in the March
Budget, are together estimated to add  3/4 percentage point to the annual
rate of underlying inflation in the fourth quarter of 1994. Underlying
inflation is forecast to fall further by the second quarter of 1995, to 3
per cent.
Given the path of underlying RPI inflation, the outlook for the all-items
rate will depend on what happens to mortgage rates. Other things being equal
a 1 percentage point change in mortgage rates changes the level of the
all-items RPI by just over  1/2 per cent.
The prospects for the GDP deflator (which measures the price of domestic
value added - principally unit labour costs and profits per unit of output)
differ from those for retail prices primarily because of its wider coverage.
The GDP deflator is forecast to rise by 3 1/4 per cent in 1993-94,
increasing to 4 per cent in 1994-95. This mainly reflects a forecast
acceleration in investment goods prices from very low levels.
Financial developments
Sterling has been relatively stable this year. Following a short period of
weakness in February and March, the sterling index has mostly traded in the
range 79 to 82; over the past three months it has averaged 80 1/2 . Against
the Deutschemark it has averaged DM2.48, 12 1/2 per cent below its average
level during the three months prior to suspension from the ERM. Sterling was
not significantly affected by the turbulence in the European Monetary System
in the summer which ended in the widening of the permitted bands of
variation.
Base rates have been reduced twice this year, in January and November.
Short-term interest rates in the UK are currently the lowest in the European
Community. Long rates have fallen significantly. Ten-year gilt yields, which
stood at 8 1/4 per cent at the beginning of the year, have recently been
under 7 per cent. The fall in long rates reflects improved confidence in the
prospects for sustained low inflation.
Equity prices grew strongly after sterling's suspension from the ERM. They
have continued to rise in recent months, reaching new highs. The commercial
property market has remained subdued, though capital values may have stopped
falling. House prices, as measured by the Halifax index, have been erratic
though rising slightly in recent months.
The 12-month growth rate of M0 has been above its monitoring range for most
of this year; and in November it was just over 5 per cent. A period of
relatively strong growth, and correspondingly low velocity growth, is not
surprising following the sharp cuts in interest rates which reduce the
incentive to economise on cash.
M4 growth has remained close to the bottom of the monitoring range set in
the March Budget. Low interest rates, relative to returns on other financial
assets, reduce the attractiveness of deposits as a savings medium.
The growth of M4 lending - bank and building society lending to the private
sector - has remained weak. The 12-month growth rate has mostly been between
3 and 4 per cent throughout 1993. Company sector borrowing in particular has
remained weak, with industrial and commercial companies repaying bank
borrowing. Companies have moved into financial surplus, reducing their need
to borrow, and capital issues have been substantial, probably reflecting the
strength of the stock market. Lending for house purchase has been one of the
stronger areas, reflecting the rise in housing turnover.
Risks and uncertainties
All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. One way of assessing
their extent is to examine average errors from past forecasts, which are
shown in an accompanying table. The range of forecasts from the Independent
Panel is another indicator of the uncertainties, as is the evolution of the
forecasts over time. Successive Treasury forecasts of GDP growth in 1993
have been progressively revised up over the past year, while forecasts of
underlying inflation in the year to the fourth quarter of 1993 have been
revised down. The projected current account deficit for 1993 was increased
in March, but has since been revised down below last year's Autumn Statement
forecast, reflecting revisions to 1992 and lower than expected outturns so
far this year.
