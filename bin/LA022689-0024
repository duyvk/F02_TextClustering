My wife, who disapproves of my own cigar smoking, does not believe George Burns 
smokes them and says he uses them only as props. Can you reaffirm for me that 
George does, indeed, smoke 20 cigars a day?

Margy Rochlin responds: After spending considerable time with Burns, I consider 
myself something of an expert on his habits. Please assure your wife that he 
definitely smokes -- but doesn't inhale -- 15 to 20 cigars a day, and I have 
the dry-cleaning bills to prove it.
