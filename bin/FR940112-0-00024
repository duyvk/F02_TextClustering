The Commission is eliminating the requirement in 
Sect.385.913(d) of the Commission's regulations that ALJs submit a revised proposed order. This action will expedite
the appeal process by removing an unnecessary, duplicative step in remedial order proceedings. Since the Commission
now finds that revised proposed orders are not necessary, draft orders that have already been submitted by ALJs to
the Commission in pending and recently completed remedial order cases will be placed in the public docket of each proceeding.
Parties do not have any additional procedural rights or opportunities by virtue of the inclusion of these draft orders
in the public docket. Under the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure in remedial order cases, the parties
already enjoy ample opportunities to present their positions fully before the Commission.

Apart from the procedural opportunities available to parties before DOE, once a matter is appealed to the Commission,
the petitioner files a detailed answer to the RO; the petitioner, DOE and intervenors may seek discovery and permission
to raise new facts or issues not raised before DOE. The parties then have an opportunity to file briefs (Rule 906); to
obtain a hearing including an opportunity for the submission of oral or documentary evidence and oral argument (and
to ask the ALJ's permission for cross-examination) (Rule 909); and to file with the ALJ proposed findings of fact and
conclusions of law and replies to these pleadings. Finally, after the ALJ has issued a decision and proposed order,
the parties may file written comments and reply comments on the ALJ's decision. (Rule 913)

III. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA)
3
 generally requires a description and analysis of final rules that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.
4
 Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Section 601(c) of the RFA defines a "small entity" as a 
small business, a small not-for-profit enterprise, or a small governmental jurisdiction. A "small business"
is defined by reference to section 3 of the Small Business Act as an enterprise which is "independently owned and 
operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation." 15 U.S.C. 632(a).

IV. Environmental Statement 
Issuance of this rule will not represent a major federal action having a significant adverse effect on the human environment
under the Commission's regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act.
5
 This rule is procedural and falls within the categorical exemptions provided in the Commission's regulations. Neither
an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment is required.

VI. Administrative Findings and Effective Date 
This final rule is a rule of agency organization and procedure that does not alter any substantive rights or interests,
but merely deletes a nonpublic, revised proposed order in remedial order proceedings that is unnecessary and duplicative
in Commission deliberations. Prior notice and comment under section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act are therefore
unnecessary.
8
 The Commission finds good cause to make this rule effective immediately upon issuance. This rule, therefore, is effective
January 4, 1994.
