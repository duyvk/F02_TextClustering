MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday acknowledged mounting cross-party concern about the
operations of the Child Support Agency and pledged to review the formula
used to assess maintenance payments by absent parents.
But the prime minister's comments, in response to a demand for changes from
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, came amid signs in Whitehall that Mr Peter
Lilley, the social security secretary, is opposing any fundamental reforms.
Mr Smith demanded an immediate review to take account of 'widespread anxiety
and dismay' over the 'rigid and inflexible' financial formula being imposed
on absent parents for the maintenance of their children.
He also attacked the agency's priorities, pointing out that of the Pounds
530m the agency was set to raise in its first year, only Pounds 50m would be
of direct benefit to children.
Mr Major defended the principles behind the agency, which from last April
replaced the system for fixing maintenance by agreement between parents or
through court orders.
He told MPs: 'The whole house recognises the need for both parents to
contribute to the bringing up of their children. The purpose of the CSA is
to ensure that fathers who desert their children face up to their
responsibilities.'
But with many Conservative MPs as critical as the Labour leader of the way
the agency makes its maintenance assessments, he acknowledged the need to
review the fact that the formula takes no account of past property
settlements or of the cost to an absent parent of exercising access.
Ms Ros Hepplewhite, the chief executive of the agency, told the Commons
social security committee yesterday that the agency's chief priority during
the first year of operation was to deal with new cases of maintenance.
But she acknowledged that in dealing with past cases it was giving priority
to cases where the parent with care of the children was in receipt of income
support and where maintenance was already being paid.
MPs have attacked the new system for failing to give priority to ensuring
that absent parents paying no maintenance were the first to be dealt with.
