(4) 
Section 236(a)(4) of the Act.
 (i) 
In general.
 (A) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) of the Act (paragraph (3) of section 236(a) before August 23, 1988) continues to
provide, as it did before the addition of paragraphs (5)(E), (6), and (7) to section 236(a), that:
(
1
) When the costs of training are paid from TAA funds under subpart C of this part, no other payment for such costs of training
may be made under any other Federal law; and
(
2
) When the payment of the costs of training has already been made under any other Federal law, or the costs are reimbursable
under any other Federal law and a portion of the costs has already been paid under such other Federal law, payment of
such training costs may not be made from TAA funds.
(B) Paragraph (4) of section 236(a) also requires that: The provisions of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (A)(
1
) and (A)(
2
) of this section shall not apply to, or take into account, any funds provided under any other provision of Federal law
which are used for any purpose other than the direct payment of the identical costs incurred in training the adversely
affected worker under the TAA Program, even if such other use has the effect of indirectly paying or reducing any portion
of the costs involved in training the adversely affected worker.
(ii) 
Application.
 (A) Although the prohibition on duplicate payments in the first part of section 236(a)(4) remains fully implemented
in this section, the second part of section 236(a)(4) on the sharing of costs from TAA funds and other Federal fund sources
is modified by the explicit provisions of paragraphs (5)(E) and (6) of section 236(a), as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)
and (b)(3) of this section.
(B) When the direct costs of a training program approvable under subpart C of this part are payable from TAA funds and
are also wholly or partially payable under another Federal law, or under any State law or from private, nongovernmental
sources, the TAA Program agencies shall establish procedures which ensure that TAA funds shall not be utilized to
duplicate funds available from another source, but this preclusion of duplication does not prohibit and shall not
discourage sharing of costs under prearrangements authorized under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
(C)(
1
) Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (4) of section 236(a), paragraph (b)(4) of this section continues to prohibit
duplicate payment of training costs, which is consistent with the general prohibition expressed in subpart C of this
part, against any use of TAA funds to duplicate payment of training costs in any circumstances. Paragraph (b)(4) of
this section also continues to prohibit taking into account, in determining whether training costs are payable from
TAA funds, any payments to the worker under any other Federal law which may have the effect of indirectly paying all
or a portion of the training costs. Such indirect payments include Veterans Educational Assistance, Pell Grants,
and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, which are paid to the individual. However, any payments to the
individual under these programs are deductible from TRA payable to the individual under Sect.617.13(c)(2).
(
2
) When payments of Veterans Educational Assistance, Pell Grants, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants
are made to the training provider, instead of the individual, and are used for training costs, such payments shall
be taken into account as direct payment of the training costs under other Federal law for the purposes of this section.
(5) 
Section 236(a)(7) of the Act.
 (i) 
In general.
 Paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act provides that a training program shall not be approved under the Act if_
(A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,
(B) the adversely affected worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and
(C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under the Act, or from
wages paid under such training program, for any portion of the costs of such training program paid under the plan or
program.
(ii) 
Application.
 Paragraph (7) of section 236(a), which is implemented in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, reinforces the prohibition
in Sect.617.22(h) against approval of a training program under subpart C of this part if the worker is required to
pay a fee or tuition. The provisions of paragraph (b) and paragraph (h) of this section shall be given effect as prohibiting
the approval under subpart C of this part of any training program if the worker would be requested or required, at any
time or under any circumstances, to pay any of the costs of a training program, however small, from any TAA funds given
to the worker or from any other funds belonging to the worker from any source whatever. Aside from this stringent limitation,
however, paragraph (7) of section 236(a) of the Act implicitly authorizes training approved under this subpart C
to be wholly or partly funded from nongovernmental (i.e., employer, union or other private) sources.
