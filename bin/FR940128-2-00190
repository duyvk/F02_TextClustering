ACTION:
 Grant of individual exemptions. 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
Notices were published in the 
Federal Register
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 
Statutory Findings 
In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings:
 
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

Exemption
The restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b)(1) and (2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application
of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the sale of
an interest in certain improved real property (the Property) from the individually directed account in the Plan of
Frederick J. Grant, M.D. (Grant), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, to Grant, provided that the following
conditions are met: 
1. The terms of the sale are at least as favorable as those the Plan could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with
an unrelated party; 
2. The sale will involve only Grant's individual account in the Plan; 
3. The fair market value of the Property (and as a result the Plan's equity in the Property) will be established by an
independent real estate appraiser; 
4. The Plan will receive no less than the greater of its share of the fair market value of the Property (minus the pro rata
portion of the encumbrance) or the total amount the Plan has expended in relation to the Property as of the date of sale;
and 
5. The Plan will receive all cash in regard to the transaction.

exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on December 17, 1993, at 58 FR 66033.
