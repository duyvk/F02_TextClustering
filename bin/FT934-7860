In the course of preparing some essays for publication, I had to look at a
chapter I had written for a book which appeared in 1989, to commemorate the
10th anniversary of the Thatcher government. The point was to see what, if
anything, should be added by way of postscript.
The answer was: Surprisingly little. That government made a start in
removing some of the impediments to economic success. During the
post-Thatcher years the ground seemed to have been lost again, first because
of the resurgence of inflation and the high interest rates needed to combat
it; and afterwards by the recession which proved longer, more drawn out and
more debilitating than almost anyone expected. Recently, however,
international comparisons have moved in favour of the UK again. Recovery, if
patchy and uncertain, has arrived earlier than in continental Europe, while
Japan is stuck in a deep recession; and the economic debate has moved to the
labour market rigidities which the UK has taken a lead in removing.
But the statistical dust of at least another business cycle will have to
settle down - and the last one went on for over a decade - before any
quantitative conclusions can be drawn. Thus I was glad to come across a book
which moves away from inconclusive numerical comparisons and sheds some
light on why even someone who welcomed the 1980s emphasis on competition and
deregulation should still feel uneasy about some of the cultural aspects of
the Thatcher revolution, including those that live on under the Major
government.
The book in question is The Economics of Business Culture by Mark Casson
(published by the Clarendon Press in 199l). It may be a surprising one for a
advocate of market competition to cite. For the author seems to hanker after
something like the 'business plan for Britain' with which John Smith wooed
gullible CBI members at Harrogate this week. And Casson does not devote
nearly enough attention to the role of competition in providing new products
and new processes, and putting downward pressure on prices.
Yet the best way to approach such a book is to see what can be learned from
it rather than where it is open to question. Professor Casson's object is to
develop a rigorous economic theory which retains the central position of
rationality in traditional economics and of the individual as the unit of
decision, but which drops the postulates of materialism and selfishness.
Without having worked through all the detailed chapters, it is difficult to
say how far he has succeeded - the book deserves more attention than it has
received. Most of the analysis relates to the internal relations of
organisations. The pupil who shared my first year economics supervision at
Cambridge, and who worried about the selfish motives of the textbook
businessman who tried to equate marginal cost with marginal revenue, might
still not have known how to react, even if he had been able to foresee this
book. Nor is it clear how the advice of top Treasury officials such as Sir
Terence Burns or Professor Alan Budd about the forthcoming UK Budget would
be different if they had absorbed Casson's message.
Yet the basic thought behind it is sound. This is that the largest costs in
a modern economy are transaction costs, and that these are minimised in an
atmosphere of trust - in contrast to an atmosphere where everyone tries to
take advantage of everyone else, and no-one moves without a lawyer. An
example of what can go wrong has just been given by a so-called rightwing
member of the British cabinet, John Redwood, when he spoke of the growth in
the number of distant Health Service 'managers in grey suits' all too ready
to solve their problems by closing down hospital wards.
What Casson does not explain is how to combine co-operation and trust within
organisations without this extending to anti-competitive collusion between
them. I still think the best solution is the one outlined in my 1985 Wincott
Lecture: an honest explanation of the benefits of competition and the profit
motive as a means to the general welfare, without making this part of the
'devil take the hindmost' view of life, so bitterly satirised in J B
Priestley's play An Inspector Calls, now enjoying such a successful revival
in London.
Competition as a system of economic relations need not be based on personal
hatred or mutual hostility. Rival small entrepreneurs linked by electronic
cable to their main customers or suppliers need hardly be more aware of each
other's existence than the small farmers of Thomas Jefferson's ideal
republic.
Market economics comes in many shapes and sizes. Casson puts his finger on
the mark when he writes that that the supply side package imported from the
US 'comes laden with certain cultural presuppositions - amongst them the
view that because people cannot be trusted, formal methods of enforcing
competition between them are essential in all areas of activity . . . The US
emphasis on the law as an enforcement mechanism is a related cultural
attitude which may not 'travel' well.' He also describes the way in which
these attitudes have been borrowed from the US when many successful private
enterprise organisations are making their management styles more human and
informal, supposedly under Japanese influence. Thus his unease extends
beyond British admirers of US economic and management styles and extends to
the tenor of the advice that the mainstream international organisations are
giving the former communist and developing countries. How does this analysis
apply to current contentious issues, such as the (now stalling) initiative
to reform the civil service through devolution to smaller agencies and
through market testing of services to ascertain whether they should stay the
public sector?
Casson seems to see such initiatives as characteristic of an authoritarian
leader who not only does not trust other people in general but 'cannot even
trust a few people to do his monitoring for him. The leader will also favour
strong interpersonal competition, sustained by making people rivals for one
another's jobs. The intensity of competition may be further raised by
creating a pool of unemployed or marginal members who are ready to step into
other people's jobs at short notice.'
These words may be a good description of how cabinets are reshuffled in
Britain. But if one wants a more co-operative style in government in
general, smaller units are the first essential. Loyalty and non-material
satisfactions are likely to be more important in an independent hospital or
in a hived-off administrative unit than in a vast organisation like the
National Health Service.
Nor, indeed, did proposals to hive off units originate with the Thatcher
administration. They date back further. I first came across them in a 1960s
Fabian pamphlet. Permanent secretaries who are obstructing the hiving-off
drive, or proposals to advertise senior Whitehall appointments, are behaving
more like male baboons fighting for territory than crusaders for higher
values.
Many people have described the paradox that market liberalisation has gone
hand-in-hand with a shift of power from intermediate sources of authority to
central government. Casson is right to detect incipient authoritarianism
behind free market rhetoric.
But another factor has surely been an excess of caution. Governments have
not had the courage to undertake the drastic reforms which would make, for
instance, local authorities or universities responsible for the bulk of
their own financing. This is why Whitehall centralisers have acquired their
hold. Perhaps the answer to the paradoxes generated by the Thatcher attempt
to get the state off the people's back is to carry it further and really
mean it.
