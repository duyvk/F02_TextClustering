ON THE bookshelves of Mr Peter Hutchison's Monterrey office sit more than
half a dozen thick, black volumes. They represent the fruit of years of hard
work during the 1980s - the documentation of the Alfa conglomerate's debt
rescheduling.
The 1980s brought a debt crisis to more than the government; many companies
such as Alfa and Femsa were forced into complex restruc-turings.
Mr Hutchison, an Anglo-Chilean who is now senior vice-president for
corporate finance and planning, moved to Monterrey 17 years ago and is now
an adopted regiomontano, as the 2m people of the city call themselves.
He says the dark days of debt restructuring are behind the company now.
None-theless, times remain tough for this steel, petrochemicals and food
business.
Alfa's two main businesses - steel and petrochemicals - received a double
shock: not only did prices in Mexico come down because tariff barriers were
reduced but world prices were depressed by the recession in much of the
industrialised world.
It has invested more than Dollars 800m in four years in meeting the
challenge of an open economy, but questions still remain about whether it
has a long-term future in its main businesses.
'Especially on the petrochemicals side, you have to ask whether the size of
the Mexican market will allow it to compete worldwide,' says Mr Pablo
Riveroll of the Bursamex stock brokerage. A further problem is the quality
of the feedstock delivered to Alfa from the state-owned oil monopoly, Pemex,
he says.
Alfa broke what seems to be an unwritten rule for success in open developing
economies: invest only in those sectors where barriers to the entry of
competition are significant, for example, in services, where cultural
differences are important or where the costs of transport from foreign
markets are high.
Mr Hutchison says there is a cushion, however, because the company's food
and other businesses - it is a leading mattress and carpet maker and also
makes auto parts - are doing well.
In June, Alfa was forced to scrap a proposed flotation of part of its Hylsa
steel-making subsidiary. Alfa was hoping to sell about 16 per cent of Hylsa
for more than Dollars 100m; in the event investors would not pay what Alfa
thought it was worth and the sale was scrapped. Mr Hutchison says the idea
has not been abandoned.
Like many Monterrey companies, Alfa has a long experience in joint ventures
with foreign companies.
Among others it is seeking a partner for textile production using its
petrochemical products.
