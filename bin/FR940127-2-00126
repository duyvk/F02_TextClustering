A prototype retirement plan is a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan that can be separately adopted by an unlimited
number of employers, the form of which plan has been reviewed and approved by the Internal Revenue Service. A prototype-like
plan is a tax-deferred retirement savings vehicle, other than a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan for which
the Internal Revenue Service does not maintain the same type of review procedures as it does for qualified pension
or profit-sharing plans.
