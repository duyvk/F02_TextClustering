<F> [Interview with Inkatha Freedom Party Central Executive </F>
Committee member Dr. Ben Ngubane in the Johannesburg studio and 
African National Congress National Executive Committee member 
Jacob Zuma in the Durban studio by announcer Leslie Mashokwe on 
the "Newsline" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] In this program tonight -- the 
declaration of UDI [unilateral declaration of independence] by 
His Majesty King Zwelithini on Friday in Ulundi and the 
cancellation of Dr. Mandela's visit to Ulundi because of an 
alleged assassination plot. We now welcome Dr. Ben Ngubane of 
the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and a minister in the kwaZulu 
Government. Good evening to you, sir, and welcome. 
  [Ngubane] Good evening. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Ngubane, is this an effective unilateral 
declaration of independence by the Zulus or not? 
  [Ngubane] Well, if His Majesty wanted to do that, he could 
have called us into the Legislative Assembly, sat on his throne, 
and declared us independent. What he was talking about, and it 
is very clear even in the shots that you played just now, that 
he was reaffirming the right of the Zulu nation to its kingdom, 
to its monarchy, to its territory. And this is what he was 
saying, that we will continue to fight for this. We will not 
give up. We will not accept the present constitution because it 
destroys the very essence. 
  [Mashokwe] But then is there intent on the part of the king 
to finally declare UDI? 
  [Ngubane] Well, if there was there would be nothing wrong 
with that either. 
  [Mashokwe] But is there? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I cannot speak for His Majesty. He speaks 
for the nation, but the Zulu people value their sovereignty, 
they value what is God-given to them, in terms of territory, 
political structures, and institutions. They do not want to 
see...[pauses] We do not want to see that swept away and being 
made, the future of the Zulu nation being made to be dependent 
on the decisions of a provincial legislature that is still to be 
elected. 
  [Mashokwe] Who is supposed to decide? South Africans sat 
together in the World Trade Center, sorted out how many regions 
we are going have, spent hours talking about the new South 
Africa. This demand, though belated, seemed to pose a threat in 
that if the Zulu people don't get it, according to His Majesty, 
then they must be prepared to fight for it. 
  [Ngubane] Well, Leslie you will remember that we had to move 
out of the World Trade Center on the 2 July because when we put 
the argument for the form of state to be decided as a 
preliminary matter we were refused the chance to debate this 
issue. That debate would have clarified all these issues that 
are coming to the fore now. We were refused and steamrolled 
because people did not want to accept that there are realities 
that will have to be taken into account when we write a new 
constitution. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand exactly where we are now 
in South Africa. The Zulu monarch almost declares UDI, or his 
intention to do so if he does not respect the new dispensation 
-- then where are we headed for? 
  [Ngubane] Well, now is crunch time. Now we are facing the 
real truths, the reality of this country, not the euphoria 
created by the press around the World Trade Center happenings, 
not the attempted universalization of the population of this 
country. We are facing the truth that we are composed of 
different nations, different groupings, and all their 
aspirations and wants must be taken into account when we write a 
new constitution. 
  [Mashokwe] Where are we headed for now? 
  [Ngubane] Well, there is still mediation going on. We are 
still carrying on with mediation which will actually restructure 
and help establish proper negotiations. There is still time to 
resolve these issues amicably. His Majesty made it very clear 
that he wishes for a peaceful and negotiated restoration of the 
Zulu kingdom. 
  [Mashokwe] Is that the cardinal point? If you don't get that 
restoration then the Zulus must not take part in the elections 
as he says? 
  [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, let's put it this way. If you do not 
eat, you die. There is no choice in that. If we do not get our 
sovereignty and a proper place within southern Africa, our 
nation will die. I mean, there is no choice in that matter. We 
have to face the issue squarely and.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] It's almost like you saying either 
give it to us or we are not part and parcel of the new 
dispensation. Then what about the consequences that may follow 
from that kind of thing? 
  [Ngubane] Leslie, we are saying -- we are not even asking 
for 
it to be given to us. We are saying -- we are a nation, we have 
a monarchy. Take us as we are and then let us decide how all 
these things will be accommodated in the new South Africa. 
  [Mashokwe] You are almost dictating terms in a situation 
where people are supposed to be negotiating about the future. 
Is that being reasonable? 
  [Ngubane] We tried to negotiate at the World Trade Center; 
we were refused that opportunity. 
  [Mashokwe] No, you walked out there.... 
  [Ngubane, interrupting] Well, because we were not being 
given 
a chance. We were going to be steam-rollered and overwhelmed. 
At the end we would be held responsible as spoilers, and so on. 
We refused that. Now we are saying, South Africa, face up to 
the reality of the situation. Mediation is offered, let 
everyone accept that mediation, and let's find a solution. 
  [Mashokwe] Are you still aware of the fact that there is a 
division within the Zulu peoples themselves? At yesterday's 
meeting, for instance, one of the chiefs there said things like, 
they are not going to obey the king. Is the king not meddling 
in political matters? 
  [Ngubane] His Majesty put it very clearly in his speech on 
Friday. He wants a democratic kwaZulu/Natal region, a 
democratic kingdom where there will be pluralism in politics, in 
economics, and in social life. He has never indicated that he 
will not tolerate different party-political formations within 
the kingdom. We shall be a kingdom like Britain is, or like 
Belgium is. 
  [Mashokwe] But that's not on offer, Dr. Ngubane. At the 
moment we're talking of a dispensation that says the king will 
have a role to play in the new dispensation, and not necessarily 
a monarchy. [Constitutional Development Minister] Roelf Meyer 
made this very clear yesterday. 
  [Ngubane] We don't need Roelf Meyer to offer us our 
sovereignty or our nationhood. All we are saying is that they 
must accommodate this reality. Let's sit around the table and 
see how we'll all work together. 
  [Mashokwe] But not all the people in the Natal area or 
kwaZulu area are in agreement with this. Even the Zulus 
themselves are divided on this issue. Is the king not dividing 
his people here? 
  [Ngubane] No. Listen, we are talking here of a state 
structure, of a state formation that existed before conquest by 
the British and annexation to Natal. This is not dependent on 
the wishes of individuals. It is the state structure of the 
Zulu nation, so some Zulus may differ and have different 
political opinions or belong to different parties. This is not 
the issue. The issue is that we have a king, we have got 
political institutions and structures that characterize the 
kingdom and the monarchy, and those are the things that we stand 
firm on -- their being sovereign, their right to.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] That does not answer the question 
on 
the fact that the Zulu people are divided. There was one very 
senior person from the monarchy who said they are going to defy 
the king. Is the king not meddling in politics, Mr. Ngubane? 
  [Ngubane] Leslie, you surprise me. Look, in any nation there 
will be different political parties, and people will be free to 
choose which party they support. This is not relevant to this 
issue under discussion. 
  [Mashokwe] It is, absolutely, in the sense that, Dr. 
Ngubane, 
you are dealing with Zulu-speaking people in that territory who 
are expressing a view different from what the king is holding -- 
which is said to be Inkatha-inclined, by the way. 
  [Ngubane] By the way, do you mean to tell me that if I form 
a 
party--XYZ party--I have a right then to say the monarchy must 
be abolished? I could never have such a right. I would be 
crazy, unless I was an insurrectionist wanting to wage 
revolution and so on. There's no way I can demand that an 
institution like the monarchy....[pauses] No one has the right 
to do that. It is God-given, it was created by history. 
  [Mashokwe] You have not yet addressed yourself to the 
question I asked you, about the divisions in the Zulu people. 
  [Ngubane] There is a division, because they belong to 
different political parties. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Ngubane, President de Klerk's offer to the 
IFP 
and the kwaZulu government -- could it not be tested to make 
sure that it at least affords you an opportunity to come into 
the fold, as it were? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I'm not sure whether you are aware what the 
details of that offer were, because.... 
  [Mashokwe] Tell me about it, if you want to. 
  [Ngubane] Well, I'm not entitled to do that, but if you 
looked at the details of that offer it would mean that the IFP 
was becoming inconsistent. The reason we are not taking part in 
this election is that we have been opposed, ever since 
negotiations, to a two-phase transition process. We've been 
opposed to allowing a constituent assembly in which the majority 
party determines what the future constitution of the country is 
going to be. This has not changed. Despite the amendments that 
were effected early this year, it has not changed that central 
issue that we'll be going to the polls to elect a majority party 
to write its own constitution. 
  [Mashokwe] Is there still hope, Dr. Ngubane, of the IFP 
coming into the elections? 
  [Ngubane] Well, there's no time for that. It would mean 
substantive changes to the constitution, amendments, and making 
the constitution properly decentralizing in its nature. There 
is no time for that. 
  [Mashokwe] The IFP will not take part in the election? 
  [Ngubane] It cannot take part, because there is no chance 
for 
us to do that. 
  [Mashokwe] What about allowing other people, then, freedom 
of 
political activities in your areas? We've had cases -- last 
week Saturday, for instance, this morning in the Durban area as 
well -- where your people effectively barred the ANC people from 
making use of a stadium. 
  [Ngubane] Well, when you say, your people, I'm not sure 
whether you are talking.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] IFP people. 
  [Ngubane] No, those were Zulu people. They could have been 
any number of Zulu people, not necessarily a political party. 
  [Mashokwe] You're not disowning them, are you? 
  [Ngubane] I'm not disowning them. They are my fellow men, my 
fellow nationals. Sure, they are royalists, they were demanding 
that the king's demands must be respected. Now this is a local 
thing. I mean, you cannot blame my party for that, the IFP for 
that. If people feel strongly about things, they do things. 
Certainly, we would like to avoid anything that disrupts peace 
and free political activity. It has never been our policy to 
bar parties from operating freely. 
  [Mashokwe] But you're barring them from holding their 
meetings in the Durban area. Local or national, the fact of the 
matter is it has happened, Dr. Ngubane. 
  [Ngubane] Leslie, I've just told you. That was not a Central 
Committee decision. It was not a party decision. If people in 
the Durban area feel so strongly about an issue -- and we don't 
even know, I mean, the details of it yet. We still need.... 
  [Mashokwe] You're copping out, Dr. Ngubane. Can we just face 
the fact. All reports have indicated that those people were IFP 
people, and you're saying to me now that I should believe that 
those people were not your people? 
  [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, you know, in this country there have 
been numerous examples where people at the local level have 
taken initiatives. One or two probably may don the uniform or 
an insignia of a party. That does not mean that the party is to 
be held responsible. I mean, we've seen this with ANC members 
getting involved in violence, with other parties getting 
involved in violence. You cannot then go and blame the party. 
  [Mashokwe] OK. Talk to me about the De Klerk offer. There 
is a suggestion that you were of heart to join the national list 
of the NP [National Party]. 
  [Ngubane] Well, what De Klerk offered was something to our 
president and to our party, and we rejected that because.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] What did he offer? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I cannot discuss this. I am not mandated to 
discuss it. 
  [Mashokwe] But could it not have helped you to jump in? 
  [Ngubane] No, it would not have helped. It would have been 
absolutely negative, because we would have been contradicting 
our own principles. 
  [Mashokwe] Does it not in any way suggest to you that the 
king's position would be looked into after the April elections? 
  [Ngubane] But that's not good enough. I mean, how do you 
establish a government and then say, we are offering you a 
chance, when already it's a fait accompli? The king told 
President de Klerk that he hoped that his demands and his 
aspirations will be attended to before elections, so that when 
the elections happen or the final settlement happens everyone is 
at home with what has been agreed. This has not happened. 
  [Mashokwe] You're not saying to me that even with the 
international mediation the IFP will still not see its way clear 
to join the election at a later stage, for that matter? 
  [Ngubane] I cannot see how you can now have results that can 
allow such a process when it is so late in the day. We asked 
for mediation way back, as far back as December. It was never 
taken up. It's only taken up very recently, and even then 
there's been a lot of dilly-dallying. We have not even 
assembled the mediation team. That's still going to have to be 
finalized and wrangled over. So there's just no chance. I 
mean, our president stated very clearly that if the things that 
we proposed in our document of 19 December, the substantive 
changes to the constitution, were accommodated, that would open 
the way to elections. But the whole process has not allowed 
that to happen. 
  [Mashokwe] Talk to me about the third force. You're once 
again in another Inkatha-gate scandal, having been said to have 
received guns from these majors and generals. Would Inkatha 
care to say, yes, we did it? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I've never heard, even on a single occasion 
in the Central Committee, such a plan being discussed. If, as 
happens in this violent country, people resort to their own ways 
of surviving, we cannot be held responsible for that. But as a 
party.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] You're not condoning it, are you? 
  [Ngubane] I'm not condoning it, but I'm talking of a 
reality--that there's violence all over the place. We hear 
horrendous stories about Transkei handling shipments of arms 
from Angola, and supplying them to MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC 
military wing] cadres, training APLA [Azanian People's 
Liberation Army] and other agencies. We hear of all these 
things. There's so much going on, we'll need everything to be 
properly investigated. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, but then already De Klerk has decided to 
suspend the generals because of the seriousness of this matter. 
Here we see a leader of the IFP in Transvaal, Mr. Themba Khoza, 
being implicated. What steps could we expect from you to show 
your concern about this whole matter? 
  [Ngubane] But surely this thing, we expect it to be 
investigated, that evidence will be led, the truth will come 
out, then we'll decide what to do -- I mean, if he is found 
guilty. But you cannot say... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] You can't actually suspend him, Dr. 
Ngubane? 
  [Ngubane] Now? Suspend him on a mere rumor? 
  [Mashokwe] Goldstone investigated this matter. And on the 
basis of the initial submissions, President De Klerk has seen it 
fit to suspend these generals -- an act of statesmanship. 
  [Ngubane] Listen, I'm not saying that the judge should not 
investigate these things. He should investigate all the causes 
of public violence. That is his mandate. What I'm saying is, 
I'm not going to jump on the throat of a colleague because he is 
accused -- which may be false, which may be true -- until I have 
the evidence that it is true. What would our followers say that 
we jump on our colleagues and we say nothing to Goldstone about 
him investigating Transkei, General Holomisa, for instance, and 
all these shenanigans? Why are those things not being 
investigated? After all, Ciskei is going to be a participant in 
the elections. Let Goldstone also investigate those people, let 
us see the whole picture, the holistic picture, then we can all 
trust that fairness is being done. At the moment we are not 
confident that fairness is being done. We think that our party 
is being singled out for smearing, our party is being castigated 
all over the world. This has happened before, and we see it as 
just another follow-up in that typical pattern. 
  [Mashokwe] Rumors of an alleged assassination plot against 
ANC President Nelson Mandela shelved a historic meeting between 
himself and King Goodwill Zwelithini at Ulundi on Friday. The 
turn of events also interrupted proceedings in the kwaZulu 
Legislative Assembly, which began its annual sitting on Friday. 
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi slammed the rumor of the alleged 
assassination plot as an attempt to destabilize kwaZulu. He 
also criticized the government for what he called subversive 
strategy to turn kwaZulu into another Bophuthatswana. 
  To get clarity on this matter, I have on the line from 
Durban 
Mr. Jacob Zuma from the ANC, and still with ne in the studio is 
Dr. Ben Ngubane from the IFP. Good evening to Mr. Zuma, and 
welcome. Could I get your reaction to the discussion we've had 
before, mostly on the issue of free political activity in your 
area? 
  [Zuma] Leslie, we have had a lot of discussions in relation 
to the issue of free political activity at all levels. We have 
been engaged with the peace structures. We have been engaged 
with the IFP bilaterally. We have discussed with the monitors 
who are down here. However, we are quite concerned with the 
recent developments around Durban here, because it does seem 
that that principle is going to be undermined, judging from the 
conduct of the supporters of the IFP in the recent.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Why do you call them supporters of 
the IFP, Mr. Zuma? 
  [Zuma] I have been told they are IFP, and supporters of the 
IFP as well. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Ngubane, you wouldn't agree with the fact 
that 
the IFP is engaged in a set-up of disrupting ANC meetings in 
that area, would you? 
  [Ngubane] Well, that would be contrary to our positions. We 
are engaged with the ANC in very delicate negotiations, even on 
the question of mediation. We would be the last ones to order 
such a thing, I mean. But as I say, it is a problem. It's 
symptomatic of the problem that we are having in this country, 
where a lot of emotions are intensifying and, you know, people 
are taking law and action to themselves without referring to 
their party hierarchy. That I cannot rule out, but I am saying, 
as far as I know, it is certainly not an IFP intention to do 
this. 
  [Mashokwe] But if the IFP people are doing it, does that 
then mean it is not an IFP thing? 
  [Ngubane] No, no. If we were given names -- I mean, you 
know, given names either through the dispute resolution 
committees and such other mechanisms, then there is something to 
work on. 
  [Mashokwe] OK. Mr. Zuma? 
  [Zuma] I would like to clarify this question, in particular 
the incident that took place at Umlazi. Clearly the IFP was 
involved in that one. They were the ones who said they were 
going to occupy the stadium to prevent the ANC supporters and 
ANC members to gather at the stadium in a rally. After that 
incident I happened to have a chat with an IFP member, who 
actually gave me the reasons why they decided to do so. That 
one I cannot doubt, because it was indicated to me quite 
clearly. The incident currently taking place at kwaMashu, it 
was reported to me, these were IFP members. But when I had a 
telephone conversation last night with [IFP National Chairman] 
Dr. Frank Mdlalose, he then informed me it was the people of the 
community, although there would be Inkatha members, but they 
were there as a community. That's why I advisedly at the 
beginning said the supporters and the IFP members. But there 
was this very specific information in regard to the Umlazi 
incident. 
  [Mashokwe] What do you do, Dr. Ngubane, if presented with 
these facts? 
  [Ngubane] Well, certainly it will be discussed in the 
Central 
Committee, because it will be a fairly serious state of affairs 
and a serious allegation. We will look at the individuals 
involved. We will talk to their regional committees or their 
branches where they come from. I mean, there are all sorts of 
processes that will be set in place. 
  [Mashokwe] OK. Mr. Zuma, was Mr. Mandela's safety 
guaranteed, his venue, on Friday when he was supposed to be with 
the king? 
  [Zuma] Certainly, as you'd know, Leslie, we had worked very 
hard for this meeting because we believe it is important that a 
meeting between the president of the ANC, Nelson Mandela, and 
his majesty the king is critical in the circumstances, and we 
made all the agreements and arrangements. As we were preparing 
to proceed to Ulundi, we first heard the announcement that there 
was an invitation to a lot of people to come and join the 
meeting. 
  [Mashokwe] Was that not part of the prearrangement? 
  [Zuma] No, that was not arranged. There was, of course -- I 
must indicate this -- there was an indication which could have 
meant this one, which was in the letter written by the chief 
minister when we were finalizing the arrangement, the letter 
that said the meeting that was to take place on Friday was no 
longer like the old arrangement kind of meeting that was 
supposed to take place between the president of the ANC and His 
Majesty the king. It would now...[pauses] Because of the issues 
that had been raised publicly by the president of the ANC, an 
interest had been generated among the royal family members, the 
amaKhosi, and other subjects of the king. There was that 
indication in the letter. There were no details as to the 
extent of the meeting. My own impression then was that perhaps, 
instead of a meeting with two small delegations, you would have 
a bigger delegation from his majesty the king's side. That's how 
I understood it. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, Mr. Zuma, hold it right there. Dr. Ngubane, 
those AK-wielding people who came to the meeting surely do not 
pose any form of safety for Mandela's visit in Ulundi? 
  [Ngubane] Well, I didn't see them except on the screen. The 
police were there, so, you know, really, it's a matter beyond 
me, beyound, you know, a member of government. Obviously 
anything that may lead to public violence has got to be curbed 
and dealt with. I regret, and President Dr. Buthelezi has 
regretted, the fact that President Mandela couldn't come to 
Ulundi, because it would have been a very important step in the 
further evolution of a negotiated settlement. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, but if you say you didn't see them, Mr. 
Ngubane, then it does give weight to the fact that they could 
even have shot without you having seen them. If you didn't see 
the AKs that everybody saw, what safety could then be guaranteed 
for a Mandela visit in Ulundi? 
  [Ngubane] What I'm getting at is, we have seen occasions 
here, gatherings, be they ANC, be they IFP, where people have 
brought in dangerous weapons. It is the duty of the security 
forces to deal with this. I do not think it was impossible for 
the security forces to handle that situation. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, the SAP [South African Police], kwaZulu 
Police, SADF [South African Defense Force] were invited. Was 
that not enough security then? 
  [Zuma] Yes, there was an indication when we raised the issue 
with the IFP leader, Dr Frank Mdlalose, the national chairperson 
of the IFP, there was an indication that preparations had been 
worked out to ensure that security was handled appropriately. 
But of course there were a number of reports that came to our 
head office from different points and corners, pointing to the 
danger which made our head office feel that it was not advisable 
for the president of the ANC to proceed to the meeting. We then 
proceeded to request a postponement or a change of venue. 
  [Ngubane] Well, you know, a visit by Dr. Mandela to Ulundi 
is 
a historic and momentous event. It is impossible to expect 
people not to take an interest in coming to this. Obviously the 
type of meeting we had has been held before -- in discussions 
with the state president in Pretoria, even in Durban, where 
people go to accompany His Majesty. At the end of the 
discussions His Majesty comes out and addresses them about the 
conclusions reached. This has happened on several occasions, so 
there was nothing strange about that. It is just unfortunate -- 
and I must repeat, we regret very much that the meeting could 
not take place. As for the future, I cannot see how you can 
prescribe to His Majesty that he should tell the Zulu people, 
don't accompany me when I'm going to meet a prominent statesman 
of this country; stay at home. I cannot see that situation. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, the ANC must be smiling to the bank now 
that revelations have been made of the third force. The IFP is 
implicated, of course. What can you tell us? 
  [Zuma] Well, Leslie, you know that for a long time now the 
ANC has made a claim that this violence in this country had a 
third force operating and manipulating it. We have said the 
reason that agreements that are forged at the political level, 
the reason that they are not implementable is because there are 
forces behind the scenes that manipulate the violence. 
Everybody has said to us: You are making false claims. Of 
course, we have said this because we knew and because we had 
information. But, of course, as long as our information was not 
investigated or verified by a respectable judge, it was easy for 
people to dismiss what we were saying. Even when there were 
cases like the Trustfeed case, where police were in fact 
investigated, charged, and convicted--still people undermined 
this particular area. I think it is clear now that what the ANC 
has been saying is actually the truth. 
  [Mashokwe] Right. Let me get Dr. Ngubane to react again to 
this issue, and ask my production team to play in the insert 
which shows that IFP people, Zulu people, were carrying these 
AK-47s, which, we have reason to believe, might have come from 
the very generals. 
  [Ngubane] Well, Leslie, I must object very strenuously to 
your blanket statement that the IFP is involved. Individuals 
may be involved, but not my party. 
  [Mashokwe] OK, IFP members then. 
  [Ngubane] Well, we don't know about that. We must still find 
out about it. But I want to come back to what Mr. Zuma has just 
said. Who has killed more than 400 IFP office bearers? Surely 
someone has killed them, and I'm not sure whether I can just say 
it's the third force and leave it at that. Who started SDU 
[self-defense units] and armed them in the townships? It was 
Msholozi's organization that did that. Who brought the culture 
of violence and people's war? 
  [Mashokwe] Let me get the team to play the insert, Dr. 
Ngubane, while you talk. 
  [Ngubane] No, but I am saying, you know, this is very 
simplistic to then suddenly apportion blame to us as being 
responsible for violence in this country. 
  [Mashokwe] Let's watch that tape. OK, while we wait for the 
tape to roll, we have to go back to you. Mr. Zuma, your people, 
your organization cannot claim to be angels. 
  [Zuma] I haven't said the ANC claims to be angels. I think 
it is a well known fact that there's been a conflict in this 
country, and one of these areas has been the conflict between 
the IFP members and ANC members. Nobody denies that fact. What 
we have persistently said is that there is a third force that 
manipulates, that controls and directs violence, that ensures 
that weapons are supplied, are bought, are circulated. This is 
the point we are making. My statement does not necessarily say 
ANC people have not been involved in violence. 
  [Mashokwe] But have they received these arms from the 
police, 
as Inkatha is said to have received them? 
  [Zuma] The ANC members have not received weapons from the 
police. The police have always seen the ANC as the enemy. 
  [Ngubane] I don't even know how true [it is] that our 
members 
have received weapons. We still need proof of this. But 
nevertheless I am saying, let us not be simplistic. Let's look 
at the violence for what it is, a monster that it is, and deal 
with it not in a way that gains oneupmanship for one party 
against the other. To deal with the matter in this manner makes 
cooperation in stemming the violence impossible. Let is look at 
what it is. If there are people who are guilty of wrongdoing, 
let the law take its course. 
  [Mashokwe] OK. I must mention that we had invited the 
generals together with General Johan van der Merwe of the SAP, 
and the generals who are implicated in this whole third force 
issue, and they have failed to turn up. We have not even heard 
from the minister of police, who was invited to be part and 
parcel of this discussion. Let's continue, gentlemen. The IFP 
is implicated, obviously; Themba Khoza is a leader of the 
Transvaal IFP. Is IFP.... 
  [Ngubane, interrupting] But I am refusing to accept this 
type 
of judgmental statement. It has been alleged. It's not proven 
yet, you know, and really we believe that a man is not guilty 
until proven. Now why are you judging the IFP so harshly? 
  [Mashokwe] I'm not judging it. All I'm saying is in a 
question form: The Goldstone Commission has identified a Mr. 
Khoza as being one of the recipients of these things. 
  [Ngubane] Well, you know, again I must say, until proven I 
cannot go by that statement. Nevertheless, how many other 
people are receiving weapons in this country? 
  [Mashokwe] Two wrongs do not make a right. 
  [Ngubane] I agree, but I'm saying until we address the whole 
thing from a holistic perspective we are going to be fiddling on 
the sides of the problem, at the periphery of the problem. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Zuma, your situation down there -- free 
political activity and these guns that we see around. Would you 
be able to be campaigning in that area? 
  [Zuma] Leslie, it is clear that we are faced with a serious 
situation here in Natal, and I think decisions that have been 
taken at the multiparty negotiating forum need to be implemented 
here. I don't think we can delay those decisions any longer. I 
think the events of the past two weekends are an indication of 
this fact. You must know that people here in Natal are 
determined to participate in the election. They want to do so 
free and fair, without intimidation, and I think.... 
  [Mashokwe] Right, let me get back to Dr. Ngubane. I am left 
with one second. Dr. Ngubane, people want to participate. Are 
you going to stop them? 
  [Ngubane] No, we are not going to stop them. We will tell 
them why we are not participating in this poll. 
  [Mashokwe] On that note, Dr. Ngubane, Mr. Zuma, thanks for 
talking to us and giving us your time.
