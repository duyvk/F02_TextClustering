L.A. TEACHER SALARY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my experience with the public schools, teachers have been talented, 
dedicated and caring. I've come home from working in my children's classroom 
for four hours, exhausted in awe of the teacher's skill and ability. 
</P>
<P>
But the pesky teachers want more money! How dare they ask for a wage that is 
comparable to the work they do! Of course, no one would just give it to them! 
They have to apply pressure. Because of this, they are accused of being 
selfish, not doing their duty, neglecting the children. It's interesting to me 
that whenever a traditionally female profession demands a fair wage, the word 
selfish gets thrown around. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are expected to uphold standards of excellence and professionalism and 
be satisfied with low salaries. If they are not content to work for the joy of 
it and little else, people like Del Olmo make accusations of selfishness and 
shortsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers that I have observed are not selfish. If they were, they'd be in 
another profession. It is we who are shortsighted. If we expect to attract 
quality people to teach our children and keep the ones we have, then we must 
pay them a decent wage. You do get what you pay for.
