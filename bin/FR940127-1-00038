If an agency requests, and the Service concurs, a formal conference report may be issued. A formal conference report
on proposed critical habitat contains an opinion that is prepared in accordance with 50 CFR 402.14 as if the critical
habitat were designated, not proposed. Such a formal conference report may be adopted as the biological opinion pursuant
to 50 CFR 402.10(d) when the critical habitat is designated, if no significant new information has been brought forward
and no changes in the action occur that would alter the content of the opinion. 
Examples of Proposed Actions 
Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat, a brief
description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may
be affected by such designation. As stated earlier, regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical
habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations
adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat
to be critical. 
A wide variety of existing and proposed activities may alter or affect proposed marbled murrelet critical habitat.
Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to timber harvest, forest management, salvage activities,
limbing or modification of limb structure (e.g., for hazard management), mining and mineral exploration, construction
of hydroelectric facilities, road construction and refurbishing, and development. Activities that do not alter
forest condition, such as some recreational use and personal-use commodity production (e.g., noncommercial mushroom
picking, Christmas tree cutting, rock collection) are unlikely to be affected by the proposed designation. 
Activities conducted according to the standards and guidelines for Late-Successional Reserves, as described in
Alternative 9 of the DSEIS for the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan would, in most cases, be unlikely to result in the
destruction or adverse modification of proposed marbled murrelet critical habitat. Activities in these areas would
be limited to manipulation of young forest stands that are not currently marbled murrelet nesting habitat. Also,
these manipulations would be conducted in a manner that would not slow the development of these areas into future nesting
habitat and should speed the development of some characteristics of older forest. 
Economic and Other Impacts 
The Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data available and to
consider the economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary
may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits
of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial
data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species
concerned. The Act thus requires the Service to evaluate the economic and other effects likely to result from a designation
of critical habitat. Effects attributable to the listing of the species, normal changes in affected industries,
or changes in Federal land management that are not caused by the designation are not regarded as effects of the designation
of critical habitat. However, due to the complex interplay of economic and other forces, separating impacts associated
solely with the designation of critical habitat from other impacts is often difficult.
