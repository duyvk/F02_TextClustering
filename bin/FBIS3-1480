  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples 
Organisation [Azapo] on Monday blamed the mayhem in Johannesburg 
earlier in the day on the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], saying 
its members should return to their senses. 
  It added, however, that the African National Congress was 
also to blame for the general political rivalry as both it and 
the IFP did not adhere to the democracy they often preached. 
"The IFP has acted irresponsibly and cowardly by killing 
innocent black people, especially children and pensioners. The 
power struggle between the IFP and the ANC is causing many black 
lives to be lost. What they are doing is not benefiting black 
people but dividing them," said Azapo Central Wits 
[Witwatersrand] region Chairman Jeff Seitshiro.
