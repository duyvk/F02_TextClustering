SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background
In accordance with the provisions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 2781), as amended,
NIST will provide assistance in FY94 to help states develop manufacturing assistance programs aimed at small- and
medium-sized manufacturers and help bring those state programs to a level of performance where they can provide the
full range of manufacturing extension services required by their manufacturers. Under the NIST Manufacturing Extension
Partnership (MEP), a cooperative effort to link and strengthen the nation's manufacturing extension programs and
activities, NIST will make merit-based awards to states to help improve their planning, coordination, and implementation
of their technology extension activities. This funding will also be available to multi-state partnerships which
seek to expand the scope of technology assistance related services regionally available to small- and medium-sized
manufacturers. MEP assumes a broad definition of manufacturing, and recognizes a wide range of technology and concepts,
including durable goods production; chemical, biotechnology and other materials processing; chemical, biotechnology
and other materials processing; electronic component and system fabrication; and engineering services associated
with manufacturing, as lying within the definition of manufacturing. 
Funding Available 
Approximately, $2,500,000 will be available to support cooperative agreements on a matching funds basis under this
program. Funding size will vary according to the project category and scope of work. For example, program planning
projects have typically averaged less than $100,000 in past years. Program Planning projects that include pilot
testing of the proposed extension plan will be eligible for NIST funding up to $150,000. For Program Implementation
projects and Regional Linkage projects, awards will also vary, but NIST funds may not exceed $250,000 per project.
States will be able to submit proposals for each of the three project categories. 
The cooperative agreements entered into under this program will be available for one year. NIST will have no obligation
to provide any additional future funding to applicants selected for funding under these projects. Renewal of an award
to increase funding or extend the period of performance will be at the local discretion of NIST. 
Projects
Program Planning Projects
Project Objective 
The purpose of Program Planning projects will be to create plans for state-wide, coordinated, technology extension
programs in order to enhance the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized manufacturers. These projects will
plan for the development and coordination of existing and/or newly formed services, such as state industrial assistance
programs; workforce training; university-based industrial assistance programs; and management assistance programs;
into a unified state-wide program. Plans will include providing access to a wide range of technology and services,
such as technology deployment, worker skills development, technology transfer and commercialization, or export
and market development. 
Applicants may conduct planning activities on a regional basis within a state, when regions are defined by the state.
Regions should be clearly defined by the proposing organizations and it must be clear why the program is regionally
oriented, versus state-wide, and how the regions will be integrated into a state-wide plan or interact such that state-wide
coverage is achieved. 
Applicants may include pilot testing activities as part of their planning process. If pilot testing of the proposed
extension plan is included in the project, it should include methods of evaluating the pilot's success in implementing
the proposed extension plan. Any proposed pilot activity must be consistent with the program plan developed for the
state. 
Program Planning Projects Evaluation Criteria 
Proposals from applicants will be evaluated and rated on the basis of the following criteria by an impartial competitive
review panel. Each proposal should address all five selection criteria and selection criteria 1-3 will be weighted
more heavily than criteria 4-5. Selection will be based upon total evaluation score as well as geographic distribution.
1. 
Target population (25 points): 
Potential applicants should specify a methodology for identifying a population of beneficiary companies (the target
population) and their technology assistance-related needs. Factors that will be considered include: 
(a) Methodology for defining the size and demographic characteristics of the target population to be served by the
program plan. 
(b) Methodology for determining the target population's assistance needs, e.g. technology, training, information,
quality improvement, management, etc. 
(c) Methodology to ensure that the plan is appropriate for addressing identified industry needs. 
2. 
Resource identification and assessment (20 points): 
Applicants should describe the methodology for collecting information about the number, size, technical sophistication,
type, and relevance of industrial assistance activities that will be part of the coordination effort. Factors that
will be considered include:
