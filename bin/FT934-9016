loss-making Brazilian industry

Brazil's newly privatised steel industry has become a highlight of the
country's inflation-racked economy. After a decade of under-investment,
price controls and mounting losses, the sector is expected to have its most
profitable year since the 1970s.
The costs of this transformation, in terms of job losses and social
disruption, have been heavy. But industry and union leaders now admit that
the changes were needed for the industry to survive. 'Brazilian society was
paying for our losses. Now we employees realise the future is in our hands,'
according to Mr Wilson Brumer, president of specialist steels company
Acesita. The company was privatised last year and returned to profit in the
second quarter of this year. It made profits of USDollars 13.3m in the first
nine months of this year, compared with Dollars 84.8m losses for that period
last year.
'We survived instead of died, partly because of the 8,000 people who lost
their jobs,' says Mr Luiz de Oliveira Rodrigues, president of the
metalworkers union at Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, the country's largest
steel producer. Since 1990, when CSN made a loss of Dollars 729m, it has cut
its workforce by a third, and this year is likely to announce record
production and profits of more than Dollars 50m.
The change in fortunes for the sector, which ranks as one of the top 10 in
the world in terms of crude steel production, started in 1990. The
government, which owned eight steel companies including the country's six
largest, announced that steel was to start off an ambitious privatisation
programme. The process was completed in September with the auction of
Acominas, the last company to be privatised, at a 90 per cent premium to the
government's minimum asking price.
The sector was chosen because, with some exceptions, it was losing the
government millions of dollars each year. This was partly due to poor
management and partly due to political interference, which included price
controls and job security rules. Mr Eduardo Modiano, in charge of the early
stages of privatisation as ex-president of Brazil's development bank, says
that since the industry was set up 50 years ago governments have pumped
USDollars 26.5bn at prices of the day into the companies that have now been
privatised. In the same period, the companies returned dividends of only
Dollars 500m to the government. Persuading managements and unions of the
need for privatisation was difficult. Steel was an important symbol of the
country's industrial emergence after the second world war. The sector also
possessed some of the country's most radical unions. A bomb exploded ahead
of the first privatisation, the 1991 sale of Usiminas, and there were
regular displays of violence at subsequent auctions.
The programme was successful mainly because the early examples were seen to
work. Once freed of price and other government controls, companies were
immediately able to restore margins and profitability. They were also able
to address the inefficiencies which had built up in the public sector.
Mr Roberto Procopio de Lima Netto, president of CSN since 1990, started
paying suppliers on time. This led to immediate savings, as the suppliers
cut their prices. They had previously included a premium when supplying
state companies because of slow or non-payment. CSN's staff cuts, which
saved about Dollars 10m a month, were unpopular. But CSN used some of the
money to pay seven months of salary arrears to its remaining workforce.
Support for Mr Procopio gradually grew.
In all privatisations, shares were reserved for workers. CSN's employees
control one of the company's largest shareholdings, with 22 per cent, of
which half is held through pension funds. Mr de Oliveira Rodrigues has also
become a member of the company's administrative board. 'The new philosophy
is of partnership,' he says.
Usiminas was seen as one of the most efficient companies, partly because of
a long-standing technical relationship with Nippon Steel of Japan, which is
also a 14 per cent shareholder. But according to Mr Rinaldo Campos Soares,
president, the company was immediately able to introduce cost savings of
about Dollars 15 a tonne, or about 5 per cent of total cost, through
renegotiated supply contracts and improved purchasing. Before privatisation,
all purchases had to be auctioned, and the cheapest bids had to be accepted
even if the quality was poor.
'Privatisation allowed the company to be more flexible. The state had become
a burden and the company couldn't grow any more,' he says.
Cost savings and productivity at Acesita, Latin America's only producer of
stainless steel, have been even more sudden. The company had been paying 33
per cent real interest rates on its borrowings. This figure has been reduced
to 12 per cent which, while still burdensome, has already saved Dollars 40m
a year in lower interest charges. Productivity in the first nine months of
the year has increased 50 per cent, of which only half is due to staff cuts.
'With 25 per cent fewer people, we're producing more,' Mr Brumer says.
These improvements in productivity and efficiency helped profitability, even
if some savings were unrepeatable and the improvements were measured against
a low base. More important were the big cost advantages Brazil's steel
industry enjoys, and which were masked by state ownership. As the world's
largest iron ore producer, Brazil's steelmakers pay about half the average
world price because of minimal transport costs. Although levels of labour
productivity are low, so are wages and electricity costs. As a result,
Brazilian exports are increasingly price competitive and increased 10 per
cent to Dollars 1.75bn in the first half of the year.
But the domestic market, still protected by average tariffs of 14 per cent
and high transport costs faced by potential importers, is more attractive,
because it allows high margins. Mr Pacifico Paoli, managing director of Fiat
of Brasil, Usiminas's largest customer, says there has been a 'tremendous'
jump in efficiency since privatisation, although this has not translated
into lower prices. 'They still try to get the advantages of the world market
price.'
Mr Francois Moyen, president of Belgo-Mineira, a private sector steel and
related products group, says the main problem facing the industry is the
country's economy. With per capita steel consumption at less than 10 per
cent of the levels of developed economies such as Japan's, he and other
industry figures talk of the domestic market's 'huge opportunities'. 'But
the potential is linked to growth in GDP and that's the problem: when is the
country going to grow?' he asks, highlighting Brazil's overall economic
uncertainty.
