The Steel Authority of India (Sail), the country's largest steel producer,
lifted net profit 18 per cent to Rs630m (Dollars 20m) for the six months to
the end of September due to increased sales and cost-cutting, writes Kunal
Bose in New Delhi.
Sail's performance contrasts sharply with that of Tata Iron and Steel, the
country's second largest steelmaker, which recently reported a sharp fall in
profit.
Sail, a state-controlled enterprise in which the government has sold a 10.52
per cent stake to private shareholders, stands out as among the most
efficient of India's large state-owned industrial enterprises.
