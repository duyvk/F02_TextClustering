SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One are the ARAC deals with is air carrier/general aviation
maintenance issues. These issues involve mechanic certification and approved training schools outlined in parts
65 and 147 and the maintenance standards for parts 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 aircraft, engines, propellers, and
their component parts and parallel provisions in parts 21, 43, 91, 121, 125, 127, 129, 133, 135, and 137 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR), which are the responsibility of the FAA Director, Flight Standards Service.
Task
Specifically, ARAC tasked the working group as follows: Review Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14_Aeronautics
and Space, Chapter I_Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, and supporting policy and
guidance material for the purpose of determining the course of action to be taken for rulemaking and/or policy relative
to the issue of acceptable and/or approved data. If ARAC determines rulemaking documents or advisory circulars are
appropriate to resolve the major/minor problem, such documents should be developed by ARAC, along with proper justifications
and any legal and economic analyses.
Reports
The working group will develop and present to ARAC for consideration any combination of the following as it deems appropriate:
1. A draft notice of proposed rulemaking proposing new requirements with regard to the issue of acceptable and/or
approved date with supporting economic and other required analysis, and any other collateral documents the working
group determines appropriate; or
2. If new or revised requirements standards or compliance methods are not recommended, a draft report stating the
rationale for those recommendations. 
The working group chair (or his designee) should:
A. Recommend time line(s) for completion of the task, including rationale, for consideration at the meeting of the
ARAC to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance issues held following publication of this notice.
B. Give a status report on this task at each meeting of ARAC held to consider air carrier/general aviation maintenance
issues; and
C. Give a detailed conceptual presentation to ARAC of the working group's recommendations before proceeding with
drafting of documents described in paragraphs A and B above.
The Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs of Alterations Working Group will be comprised of experts from those organizations
having an interest in the task assigned. A working group member need not necessarily be a representative of one of the
member organizations of the ARAC. An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member
of the working group should write the person listed under the caption

 expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task, and the expertise he or she would bring to the working
group. The request will be reviewed with the Assistant Chair of the ARAC for air carrier/general aviation maintenance
issues and the Chair of the Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs or Alterations Working Group, and the individual
will be advised whether or not the request can be accommodated.
The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the formation and use of the ARAC are necessary in the public interest
in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law. Meetings of the ARAC to consider air carrier/general
aviation maintenance issues will be open to the public except as authorized by section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act. Meetings of the Clarification of Major/Minor Repairs or Alterations Working Group will not be open
to the public, except to the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No
