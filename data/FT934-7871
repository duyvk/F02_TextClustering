FT  18 NOV 93 / Technology: Artificial look into the real world - Virtual
reality is taking off in the games field, but its impact on industry has so
far been limited. That is now set to change

To most people, virtual reality means video games and entertainment arcades.
The idea of using the technique - in which three-dimensional surroundings
are created by computers for viewing on headsets or desk-top terminals - has
hardly penetrated beyond the leisure industry.
But manufacturers are turning increasingly to this artificial, 3-D world for
help with the design and development of new products. The virtual reality
research programmes run by universities and other research centres have
attracted a number of companies, including Caterpillar, the US manufacturer
of earthmoving equipment, and two UK groups, Rolls-Royce and VSEL (formerly
Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering).
The potential of VR for helping business and cutting costs was demonstrated
in the Netherlands earlier this year when the Calibre Institute at the
University of Eindhoven developed a system for construction companies. It
enabled prospective house buyers to 'walk through' new homes at a greenfield
site before they had even been built. An increase in sales was reported
while VR was in use there.
Caterpillar has based its research work at the National Centre for
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. Much of the work
is experimental, but the company is using stereo glasses and full-immersion
headsets to develop operator cabs for backhoe loaders and wheeled shovels.
'We use the system as a design tool to check operator visibility and
evaluate performance of design,' explains Richard Ingram, Caterpillar's
manager of university relations. He is guarded about the financial savings
that Caterpillar expects, but compares VR's possible impact with the way
spreadsheets and personal computers revolutionised the accountancy
profession.
'It can take from six months to a year to design and build a prototype
vehicle. With virtual reality, we can put a new design into the lab in a
week,' he says. Caterpillar invites digger operators to the centre's
laboratory where they sit in a conventional cab seat wearing a headset.
Immersed in a virtual world, they can glance outside the virtual cab and
watch the machine's bucket rise and fall as they control it with real
levers. Functions, however, are kept simple, dictated by the speed at which
computers can display the movements in real time. If the operator dislikes
one cab, an alternative design can be called up.
In the UK, a close-knit community of universities and small research
companies is now starting to attract support from industry. 'Virtual reality
is not yet a finished production tool. And even though basic systems cost
around Pounds 40,000, companies will initially prefer to work with centres
of excellence,' says Seamus Morley, sales manager of Division Group, a
leading UK-based supplier of VR systems for industrial applications.
Division has sold more than 50 fully immersive systems worldwide and a few
weeks ago shipped what it describes as the world's largest commercial VR
system to Matsushita Electric in Japan. Valued at some Dollars 500,000
(Pounds 331,000), the system will enable three people to share the same
virtual world.
Coventry School of Art and Design, part of Coventry University, purchased a
VR system in March. It is now collaborating with companies such as Ford,
Rover and Motor Panels, the truck cab specialist. 'We're using virtual
reality for design evaluation and interaction,' explains David Pryce-Evans,
project researcher. The aim is to enable vehicle designers to see and
interact with a full-sized car without going to the expense of building one.
The next step is to expand the breadth of interaction, says Pryce-Evans, and
move into consumer products such as kettles and cameras. Rolls-Royce and
VSEL are among a number of companies which have joined a research programme
run by Advanced Robotics Research, a company based at Salford University.
Rolls-Royce, which joined the programme in July, wants to convert
computer-aided design models of its Trent high-thrust aero-engine into
real-time VR images. 'The aim is to put engineers next to a virtual rather
than real model of the engine,' explains Robert Stone, technical manager of
Advanced Robotics.
Rolls-Royce says it has been interested in VR for a year and believes there
will be a 'clear financial pay-off' if the system proves to be a practical
tool. VSEL has been using advanced three-dimensional Cad modelling with
full-sized and one-fifth scale models of submarines for eight years. Now, it
wants to eliminate the real models and allow engineers to 'enter' virtual
submarines for design verification.
Despite an impressive membership list which also includes ICI and British
Nuclear Fuels, Stone says he is concerned at the 'apathy' shown by much of
industry. 'The UK is leading the way in VR research, but people still see it
as a computer game; there's too much hype from the leisure industry,' he
says.
He admits that introducing VR to manufacturing industries will not be easy.
The technology is still relatively expensive and the clarity of images
comparatively poor.
A new convert to virtual reality is the supermarket sector. Britain's
Co-operative Wholesale Society recently joined the programme run by Advanced
Robotics. Its corporate technology department is keen to have a virtual
supermarket so it can study customer flows and space planning. Presumably,
though, it will stop short of virtual customers and virtual profits.
