<F> [Statement by Suzanne Vos, member of the IFP Central </F>
Committee, issued by the office of the chief minister of kwaZulu 
on the SAPA PR wire service on 22 March] 
  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] yesterday provided 
Mr Justice Richard Goldstone with a copy of a document, obtained 
by an informant, outlining ANC [African National Congress]/SACP 
[South African Communist Party] proposals to produce a situation 
of "ungovernability" and "crisis" in kwaZulu through "mass 
action", including the destabilisation of the kwaZulu civil 
service. 
  The central committee of the IFP is in no doubt that this 
document is authentic and has requested Judge Goldstone to 
investigate its contents as a matter of urgency. The informant 
cannot be publicly identified for reasons of his/her safety. 
  The document (attached) reveals sinister ANC/SACP plans to 
secretly orchestrate "emerging instability" in kwaZulu, leading 
to TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and military 
intervention, while publicly downplaying the actual and direct 
involvement of the alliance. 
  The author(s) confirm reports from IFP intelligence sources 
that there are approximately 2,000 members of Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] (MK) deployed in 
so-called "self-defence" units [SDU] throughout Natal, working 
together with members of the Transkei Defence Force and "several 
thousand" informally trained SDU members. 
  Cynical reference is made to "carefully considered" 
approaches to his majesty the king of the Zulu nation, designed 
"as a means to an end -- the destruction of Buthelezi's 
political and social base." We have provided Judge Goldstone 
with official ANC documentation using the same language. 
  The contents of this document go far beyond robust politics 
and we believe the proposals, if implemented, would plunge 
kwaZulu/Natal into full-scale civil war. 
  The IFP and the kwaZulu government have long borne the brunt 
of a sustained campaign of violence and intimidation initiated 
by the ANC/SACP alliance and there is already evidence that the 
steps, as outlined, to attempt to destabilise the kwaZulu civil 
service have begun. The untruthful and insidious propaganda 
about the safety of kwaZulu government pensions (paid, in fact, 
to the South African Government in terms of the South African 
Government Pensions Fund Act of 1956) is but one example. 
  The document is taken seriously and viewed with alarm as the 
tactics and strategies enuniciated merely follow through 
existing and blatant ANC/SACP political machinations ignored, of 
the most part, by what appears to be a national and 
international conspiracy of silence and obfuscation in holding 
the ANC/SACP alliance directly accountable for its overt ANC 
covert actions in kwaZulu/Natal, Bophuthatswana, and elsewhere. 
  March 21, 1994 
  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone, 
  Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention of Public 
Violence and Intimidation, 
  4th Floor, 24 Sandpark Building, 
  Fredman Drive Sandton. (by hand) 
  Dear Sir, 
  With Ref: "Prepare the Anvil for the Coming Hammer Towards a 
Programme of Action in Natal" 
  I have been instructed by the president of Inkatha Freedom 
Party, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to provide you with a copy 
of a document (attached) which was obtained by an informant late 
last week. 
  The informant insists that his/her identity remain a secret 
and that under no circumstances can it be revealed as the person 
fears for his/her life. This informant insists that the 
document is genuine and was produced by a senior member(s) of 
the SACP/ANC alliance. Any further details in this regard would 
jeopardise revealing the identity of the informant. 
  The document was studied by the central committee of the IFP 
at a meeting on Saturday, March 19. It was the view of the 
central committee that the contents warrant your immediate 
attention and urgent investigation. 
  We highlight, in particular, the intention to produce a 
situation of "ungovernability" and "crisis" in kwaZulu through 
"mass action", combined with other strategies as described, 
including the destabilisation of the kwaZulu civil service. 
  The author(s) of the document outline tactics to produce 
"emerging instability" in kwaZulu, secretly orchestrated, noting 
that "direct ANC involvement must be played down." 
  "Immediate proposals" call for (in part) creating 
condition??V??Zich would lead to "future military intervention 
in kwaZulu" and the direct involvement of the TEC. 
  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone: 
  The IFP equally views as extremely sinister the expressed 
requirement of "restrengthening of an effective MK's (sic) 
presence and more active implementation of people's self-defence 
measures", coupled with the information that there are 
"approximately 2,000 MK members deployed in a self-defence 
capacity throughout Natal, several thousand informally trained 
SDU members, as well as disposition of some members of the TDF 
(Transkei Defence Force)." 
  The author(s) admit "successful and long-term efforts by the 
people's movement to isolate Buthelezi and separate Inkatha from 
its constituency and potential constituencies", which we observe 
is a direct acknowlegement of the tactics of violence and 
intimidation employed against members and supporters of the IFP 
over a considerable period of time. 
  We have every reason to believe that this document is 
authentic and goes far beyond robust politics in its call for 
the creation of conditions "for the fall of kwaZulu" and efforts 
to "win over" his majesty the king of the Zulu nation through 
"carefully considered and assessed approaches" as a "means to an 
end -- the destruction of Buthelezi's political and social base." 
  We therefore formally request that your commission accepts 
the very real concern expressed by the IFP in urging that this 
document and the information as well as the tactics and 
strategies outlined therein be taken extremely seriously. 
  It has been decided that we will release the document to the 
media tomorrow, Tuesday March 22, following your receipt today 
of this communication. 
  [Signed] Yours sincerely, Suzanne Vos Member, Central 
Committee, IFP

<H3>  Prepare the Anvil for the Coming Hammer Towards a Programme 
of Action in Natal </H3>
  The recent period has seen further-dramatic shifts in the 
balance of power towards the people's camp. The collapse of the 
Mangope regime in the Bophutatswana bantustan is a signal 
achievement in this regard. 
  The demise of the tyrant Mangope represents a serious 
reverse 
for the forces of counter-revolution in our country. It is a 
reverse from which these forces cannot recover. Continuing 
maximum all-round pressure must continue to be exerted against 
remaining, and weakening obstacles to a democratic transition. 
  The most significant outstanding obstacle which confronts 
the 
people's movement is the problem of Buthelezi and the IFP. 
Events in Bop [Bophuthatswana], combined with the deteriorating 
situation in Natal now urge the accelerated implementation of a 
strategy, which though generally accepted within the movement, 
needs to be more fully elaborated. 
  That strategy is the destruction of the kwaZulu bantustan 
and 
its reincorporation within a united, non-racial and non-sexist 
South Africa. Though timing is important, the fact of kwaZulu's 
reincorporation, together with the destruction of Buthelezi's 
power-base cannot be gainsaid. Whether that emerges as a final 
moment, or whether that destruction is process-based, conditions 
for the fall of the kwaZulu bantustan must speedily be created. 
  Bop has served to underline the fatal weakness of all the 
bantustan administrations. That is that they cannot survive for 
long without the financial support from the De Klerk government. 
Combined with the long-standing programme of mass action against 
Mangope, the mere threat that the tap would be tightened, 
combined to create a situation of ungovernability, culminating 
in an effective military coup by South African security forces. 
  Though conditions in kwaZulu and Bop differ materially, and 
the strategy of the people's movement towards the Mangope regime 
cannot be mechanistically applied, our strategy towards kwaZulu 
includes important common elements. 
  There can be no doubt that sufficient consensus now exists 
within the TEC for using maximum firmness for dealing with 
threats to a democratic transition. But we must first create 
conditions, primarily through mass action, heightened public 
awareness and work amongst kwaZulu civil servants, for decisive 
state intervention in that bantustan. In other words, we must 
need to prepare the anvil for the coming hammer. 
  Successful and long-term efforts by the people's movement to 
isolate Buthelezi and separate Inkatha from its constituency and 
potential constituencies have unfortunately been offset by 
serious and unexpected reverses in the Natal region. 
Principally this is evident in the growth of ethnic chauvinism 
under the banner of the Zulu King Zwelethini. Not only has this 
stabilised Buthelezi's support base, but this unprecedented and 
dangerous ethnic mobilisation poses a grave threat to the united 
non-racial South Africa which is the lodestar of the liberation 
movement. 
  This expanding chauvinist mobilisation is combined with 
increasing militarisation or this reactionary constituency, 
assisted by the cynical involvement of former members of the 
apartheid security forces. This militarisation, which has at 
its core the provision of military training to IFP supporters 
has contributed to the dramatic upswing in violence against the 
people's movement in both Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. 
  These dangers counsel for accelerated implementation of a 
strategy which has as its objective the destruction of the 
kwaZulu bantustan. Apart from the burning need to create 
conditions in which free and fair elections can be held, it is 
only the destruction of the kwaZulu bantustan, and its 
reincorporation under a government committed to non-racial 
goals, that the poisonous weed of tribal chauvinism can be 
finally cut down and the violence attached to its obnoxious 
cause effectively suppressed. 
  Immediate proposals for the ending of this state of affairs 
are as follows. 
  --The Natal situation should be more closely monitored by a 
task force of the TEC, and decisive practical steps recommended 
vis-a-vis the Natal situation. All intelligence reports 
generated within state intelligence organisations which relate 
to the Natal situation should therefore be provided to and 
analysed by this task force. 
  --Parts of Natal should be declared disaster areas and 
similar steps taken here as on the East Rand. Principally, 
security force functions presently carried out by the ISD 
[Internal Stability Division] should be assumed by the SADF 
[South African Defense Force] and NPKF [National Peacekeeping 
Force]. 
  In particular, those units which proved themselves most 
reliable in Bophutatswana, should be considered for priority 
deployment in crisis areas of Natal. For its part, the SAP 
[South African Police] in Natal may well prove unreliable in any 
such TEC initiative. With a view to future military 
intervention in kwaZulu, the SAP leadership in Natal must be 
firmly subordinated to the TEC. 
  --The military training and deployment of IFP members in 
Natal also requires restrengthening of an effective MK's 
presence, and more active implementation of people's 
self-defence measures. In any event any security action 
considered by the TEC should be supplemented by informal MK 
deployments. 
  According to intelligence sources approximately 5,000 IFP 
members have been trained in a relatively short space of time. 
Counterpoised to this private army are approximately 2,000 MK 
members deployed in a self-defence capacity throughout Natal, 
several thousand informally trained SDU members, as well as 
disposition of some members of the TDF. 
  The development of what is by all accounts a disciplined IFP 
military capability -- an important factor in political violence 
in the Natal region and beyond -- is deeply disturbing and 
requires urgent TEC attention. This training and the murderous 
activities of its products need to be suppressed as a matter of 
urgency. 
  --The TEC also needs to assume the payment of salaries of 
amakhosi [chiefs] subordinating reactionary institutions to the 
control of the TEC and a new democratic order is necessary not 
only a prelude to their transformation, but it removes an 
important instrument of social control from the hands of 
Buthelezi and the IFP. 
  --The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] needs to assume 
a far more active role in Natal. 
  --This must be combined with the organisation of a broad 
front of forces against any disruption of elections or further 
chauvinist inspired attempts to balkanize the country. This 
organisation could also serve as the basis for further isolation 
of Buthelezi and the IFP. 
  --Most critical of all is work amongst the kwaZulu civil 
service, and efforts to win over the Zulu king. In this regard 
Zuma's diplomacy should be understood as a means to an end -- 
the destruction of Buthelezi's political and social base. Apart 
from Zuma's sympathy for the incarnations and institutions of 
tribal consciousness, he may confuse the means as an end in 
itself. Approaches to the king therefore must be carefully 
considered and assessed and continuously oriented within the 
purposeful strategic framework of the liberation movement. 
  Organisation amongst civil servants must be immediately 
stepped up. Though significant advances have already been made 
in this regard and important sectors of the kwaZulu civil 
service are already organised by the ANC and allied formations, 
continuing efforts must be made to persuade civil servants that 
job security and their pensions can only be secured by a 
people's government and not by tribal despots of Buthelezi's 
mould. One may go so far to say that the kwaZulu civil service 
is the most important base of ANC support north of the Tugela. 
And, even though the KZP [kwaZulu Police] have traditionally 
functioned as Buthelezi's private army, increasingly members of 
the KZP, including command elements, side with the people's 
movement. It is clear that in a situation of crisis Buthelezi 
cannot take the loyalty of the KZP for granted. 
  One of the stabilising pillars of the bantustans under 
apartheid rule was the development of a bureaucratic bourgeoisie 
whose interests were fundamentally bound up with the continued 
existence of these administrations. This pillar has now been 
removed. The class interests of this stratum now lie outside 
the bantustan administrations. Only a new, non-racial 
democratic state can secure its interests. This motivation was 
a principal factor in rendering Bophutatswana ungovernable. 
  Though the kwaZulu administration differs in that it has a 
social base, a vast number of civil servants do not identify 
with this base. Thus, whilst the kwaZulu administration poses a 
challenge to the people's forces, this challenge is hardly 
insurmountable. The role of white civil servants and central 
state appointees should not be overlooked. A common commitment 
between the people's movement enlightened elements of the SAG 
[South African Government] to foreclose upon the powers of the 
kwaZulu bantustan, as in Bop, could lead to further 
disorganisation of efforts by IFP and tribal loyalists within 
the kwaZulu bantustan administration to resist TEC decisions and 
to act against our own organisation within those structures. 
  Combined with mass action, and stepped up organisation 
within 
the sectors of the kwaZulu government, a situation of 
ungovernability could reproduce itself fairly rapidly in the 
areas it administers. Though the consequences will be more 
extensive than in Bop, this should not deter us from the 
political correctness of such a strategy. It is important 
however for this crunch moment to have an appearance of 
spontaneity and popular support. Direct ANC involvement must be 
played down. 
  Emerging instability within kwaZulu, as well as providing an 
increased public profile to acts of violence, particularly when 
directed against the ANC and its allies should provide a 
persuasive argument for TEC intervention in kwaZulu. The tempo 
and extent of that intervention will be conditioned by 
development of these conditions and the degree of resistance 
encountered by the TEC. 
  Comrades within the TEC have made it clear that in 
conditions 
of growing instability or ungovernability, and partial or 
general uprising, or organised resistance to the imperatives of 
a new democratic order, that as in Bop, decisive military steps 
will be taken. In this regard no centre of counter-revolution 
or tribal chauvinism which stands outside the process of popular 
integration should be considered exempt from pre-emptive action.
