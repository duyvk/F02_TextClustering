could trigger a conflict in the most heavily-armed area on earth

The presidents of the US and South Korea are expected to make a last-ditch
attempt to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme
when they meet in Washington today.
In an effort to defuse the mounting tension between North and South Korea,
President Bill Clinton and President Kim Young-sam are likely to offer to
suspend the joint annual Team Spirit military exercise in South Korea. In
return, they will seek a resumption of international inspections of North
Korean nuclear facilities and talks on de-nuclearisation of the Korean
peninsula.
The deal could pave the way to settle a dispute sparked by North Korea's
threat to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. If Pyongyang
offers proof it has ended its nuclear arms development programme, the US has
suggested it might grant diplomatic recognition and provide economic aid.
The latest US initiative follows a statement by North Korea that it would
consider a package of simultaneous compromises with Washington. Both sides
are racing against time. A possible declaration in the next few weeks by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that North Korea has broken
nuclear safeguards by refusing to accept inspections could force the UN
Security Council to consider economic sanctions on Pyongyang. That might
trigger a hostile response by North Korea and lead to a conflict in the most
heavily-armed area on the planet.
'A war on the Korean peninsula might last only a month and end in the defeat
of North Korea, but the destruction would be unimaginable,' a western
diplomat said. Whether such an apocalyptic event will occur depends on North
Korea's true intentions in provoking the crisis and the west's response to
it.
The prime aim of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme seems to be to ensure
survival of North Korea and the ruling family of President Kim Il-sung.
North Korea is confronting increased problems in the post-cold war world.
Its economy has shrunk by an annual 5 per cent in the past three years.
Reports persist of disturbances caused by food shortages. Abroad, collapse
of the socialist bloc has left the North isolated, as witness the recent
140-1 vote in the UN General Assembly urging Pyongyang to comply with
nuclear inspections.
The North has lost the support of one key ally, Russia, and relations have
cooled with another, China, after Moscow and Beijing set up diplomatic ties
with Seoul. Even the North's conventional military force, although bigger
than the South's, is ageing, while Seoul rapidly modernises its army.
It is an insecure North Korea that views nuclear weapons as the ultimate
guarantee of its continued existence. 'It's the last card they have left to
play,' says Mr Adrian Foster-Carter, director of the Leeds University Korea
Project.
But how Pyongyang plans to use that card is open to question. Some of those
who favour a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear issue argue that
Pyongyang may be intent on taking South Korea by force once it completes the
development of nuclear weapons. Possession of nuclear missiles aimed at US
military bases in Japan might force the US to think twice about supporting
Seoul in a conflict.
But other analysts believe North Korea would never risk invading South Korea
again as it now lacks powerful allies. Instead, Pyongyang is engaged in a
high-stakes game of diplomatic poker, using its nuclear programme as a means
to win concessions.
These would include US diplomatic recognition, which would imply
international acceptance for the permanent division of Korea, and western
economic aid. Adding to the uncertainty over North Korea's nuclear programme
are varying estimates of how close Pyongyang is to producing a nuclear
weapon. US intelligence estimates range from a few months to five years.
Whatever North Korea's nuclear intentions are, the US has based its
opposition to Pyongyang's possession on two main grounds: one, it would deal
a blow to efforts to stop nuclear proliferation. North Korea's acquisition
of nuclear weapons, despite being a signatory to the nuclear safeguards
treaty, would encourage others to violate the agreement; two, the US fears a
renegade North Korea could provoke a nuclear arms race in north-east Asia by
forcing Seoul and Tokyo to follow suit. Pyongyang might also emerge as a
supplier of nuclear technology to other anti-western nations.
The US has few options to stop North Korea's nuclear programme. A
pre-emptive attack on the North's Yongbyon nuclear facilities is highly
unlikely; it would almost certainly precipitate an attack on South Korea.
Economic sanctions are also questionable. China may veto a sanctions
resolution in the UN as it tries to extend its influence in the region by
protecting North Korea. The US is urging Beijing to support sanctions if
China's efforts to intercede with the North Koreans fail.
Even if sanctions are imposed, they could be ineffective. North Korea's
border with China, its chief outside source of oil and food, is porous.
Moreover, sanctions could provoke an attack by North Korea. 'Sanctions are
regarded as being perilously close to an engagement of war and the North may
see no alternative but to fight,' one diplomat said. For this reason, China,
South Korea and Japan are urging the US to be cautious over sanctions.
The US so far has pursued a conciliatory approach to solving the nuclear
inspection issue. But pressure is growing in Washington for the Clinton
administration to adopt a tougher approach if North Korea refuses to accept
IAEA inspections soon.
'The Clinton administration is already being criticised for being weak on
foreign policy; to some in Washington the offers to North Korea smack of
appeasement. I don't know if the administration could sell diplomatic
recognition to the US public and media even if North Korea accepts full
inspections,' one US official says.
If North Korea is engaged in diplomatic brinkmanship, it may have to decide
soon whether to accept the present package of US concessions, instead of
holding out for more and risking seeing them disappear.
Washington and Pyongyang may be seriously seeking a negotiated solution to
the dispute, but the situation is still fraught with possibilities for
miscalculation, and for conflict.
