(d) Witnesses shall first be examined by their attorney and by opposing attorneys for their competency to support
their written testimony and exhibits (voir dire).
(e) Witnesses may then summarize, highlight or read their testimony. However, witnesses may not materially supplement
or alter their written testimony except to correct it, unless the Panel expands the witness' testimony to complete
the record.
(f) Parties are entitled to raise objections to evidence on any proper ground during the course of the hearing, including
an objection that an opposing party has not furnished nonprivileged underlying documents. However, they may not
raise objections that were apparent from the face of a written case and could have been raised before the hearing without
leave from the Panel. See Sect.251.45(c).
(g) All written testimony and exhibits will be received into the record, except any to which the Panel sustains an objection;
no separate motion will be required.
(h) If the Panel rejects or excludes testimony and an offer of proof is made, the offer of proof shall consist of a statement
of the substance of the evidence which it is contended would have been adduced. In the case of documentary or written
evidence, a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall constitute the offer of proof.
(i) The Panel shall discourage the presentation of cumulative evidence, and may limit the number of witnesses that
may be heard on behalf of any one party on any one issue.
(j) Parties are entitled to conduct cross-examination and redirect examination. Cross-examination is limited
to matters raised on direct examination. Redirect examination is limited to matters raised on cross-examination.
The Panel, however, may limit cross-examination and redirect examination if in its judgment this evidence or examination
would be cumulative or cause undue delay. Conversely, this subsection does not restrict the discretion of the Panel
to expand the scope of cross-examination or redirect examination.
(k) Documents that have not been exchanged in advance may be shown to a witness on cross-examination. However, copies
of such documents must be distributed to the Panel and to other participants or their counsel at hearing before being
shown to the witness at the time of cross-examination, unless the Panel directs otherwise. If the document is not,
or will not be, supported by a witness for the cross-examining party, that document can be used solely to impeach the
witness's direct testimony and cannot itself be relied upon in findings of fact as rebutting the witness' direct testimony.
However, upon leave from the Panel, the document may be admitted as evidence without a sponsoring witness if official
notice is proper, or if, in the Panel's view, the cross-examined witness is the proper sponsoring witness.
(l) A CARP will encourage individuals or groups with the same or similar interests in a proceeding to select a single
representative to conduct their examination and cross-examination for them. However, if there is no agreement on
the selection of a representative, each individual or group will be allowed to conduct its own examination and cross-examination,
but only on issues affecting its particular interests, provided that the questioning is not repetitious or cumulative
of the questioning of their parties within the group.
Sect.251.48 
Rules of evidence.
(a) 
Admissibility. 
In any public hearing before a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, evidence that is not unduly repetitious or cumulative
and is relevant and material shall be admissible. The testimony of any witness will not be considered evidence in a
proceeding unless the witness has been sworn.
(b) 
Documentary evidence. 
Evidence that is submitted in the form of documents or detailed data and information shall be presented as exhibits.
Relevant and material matter embraced in a document containing other matter not material or relevant or not intended
as evidence must be plainly designated as the matter offered in evidence, and the immaterial or irrelevant parts shall
be marked clearly so as to show they are not intended as evidence. In cases where a document in which material and relevant
matter occurs is of such bulk that it would unnecessarily encumber the record, it may be marked for identification
and the relevant and material parts, once properly authenticated, may be read into the record. If the Panel desires,
a true copy of the material and relevant matter may be presented in extract form, and submitted as evidence. Anyone
presenting documents as evidence must present copies to all other participants at the hearing or their attorneys,
and afford them an opportunity to examine the documents in their entirety and offer into evidence any other portion
that may be considered material and relevant.
(c) 
Documents filed with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or Copyright Office. 
If the matter offered in evidence is contained in documents already on file with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
or the Copyright Office, the documents themselves need not be produced, but may instead be referred to according to
how they have been filed.
(d) 
Public documents. 
If a public document such as an official report, decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic data, is offered
in evidence either in whole or in part, and if the document has been issued by an Executive Department, a legislative
agency or committee, or a Federal administrative agency (Government-owned corporations included), and is proved
by the party offering it to be reasonably available to the public, the document need not be produced physically, but
may be offered instead by identifying the document and signaling the relevant parts.
(e) 
Introduction of studies and analyses. 
If studies or analyses are offered in evidence, they shall state clearly the study plan, all relevant assumptions,
the techniques of data collection, and the techniques of estimation and testing. The facts and judgments upon which
conclusions are based shall be stated clearly, together with any alternative courses of action considered. If requested,
tabulations of input data shall be made available to the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel.
(f) 
Statistical studies. 
Statistical studies offered in evidence shall be accompanied by a summary of their assumptions, their study plans,
and their procedures. Supplementary details shall be included in appendices. For each of the following types of statistical
studies the following should be furnished:
(1) 
Sample surveys. 
(i) A clear description of the survey design, the definition of the universe under consideration, the sampling frame
and units, the validity and confidence limits on major estimates; and
(ii) An explanation of the method of selecting the sample and of which characteristics were measured or counted.
(2) 
Econometric investigations. 
(i) A complete description of the econometric model, the reasons for each assumption, and the reasons for the statistical
specification;
(ii) A clear statement of how any changes in the assumptions might affect the final result; and
