A TEST THAT'S EASY TO FLUNK;

IDEOLOGY: NOT MANY OF US COULD COUNT OURSELVES RESISTERS TO A TRULY HOSTILE

The young apparatchiks of the Soviet Communist Party are said to be having no 
trouble adjusting to the new political order. The day after the party's Central 
Committee renounced Communism's monopoly on power, students at Moscow's Higher 
Party School were already spouting the new dogma. 
</P>
<P>
The flexible ideologue is an ancient social type, dating back at least to 
England's famous Vicar of Bray, who became a Protestant or a Catholic depending 
on the whim of the monarch of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is law, I will maintain 
</P>
<P>
 Unto my dying day, sir 
</P>
<P>
 That whatsoever king shall reign 
</P>
<P>
 I will be the Vicar of Bray, sir! 
</P>
<P>
 The deft vicar kept his perks. But events moved too fast for some East German 
party hacks, who now find themselves in prison for the salamis of six months 
ago. But let's not be smug. These folks were just playing the game by the rules 
they were given, as most of us do. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it makes a pretty good parlor game. Which people in the Bush 
Administration would be members of the Politburo and which, if any, would be 
dissidents? The President himself, son of a senior regional apparatchik? James 
Baker? Can you see our secretary of state freezing in Siberia for his belief in 
freedom and democracy? Richard Darman? Robert Mosbacher? The Doles? Well, now 
that you mention it, I can sort of imagine Bob Dole warming his bile over a 
coal fire for a couple of decades in a gawd forsaken place with a name like 
Yukst because of some unfortunate remark to Stalin around 1949. But as for most 
of the rest, it's apparatchik city. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to suggest that the rest of us would be heroes. Even by Washington 
standards, the Bush crowd strikes me, at least, as especially characterized by 
ambition unhinged from principles of any sort, good or bad. But no doubt most 
of us would accommodate, not rebel. In his famous first speech as president of 
Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel said that everyone shared responsibility for the 
"contaminated moral atmosphere" the country inherited because, "We had all 
become used to the totalitarian system and accepted it as an unchangeable fact 
and thus helped to perpetuate it." This is stirring but overmodest, coming from 
a man who spent years in jail for opposing the system. Nevertheless, a 
corollary of its central truth is that those of us fortunate enough never to 
have been put to the test would have flunked it, too. 
</P>
<P>
I recently heard the following dialogue between an American left-wing 
intellectual and a reformed left-wing intellectual who is now a professional 
apostate, making a comfortable living as a disparager of his former views: 
</P>
<P>
Reformed Lefty: If people like you were in power, people like me would be in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Lefty: If people like me were in power, people like you would still be on our 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Lefty pretty clearly won that exchange. Some people's principles can't even 
survive a couple of presidential elections, let alone decades of totalitarian 
suppression. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that everyone except the occasional Vaclav Havel is corrupt, 
a bad person. Good people, even admirable, heroic people, can't always see 
moral scandals that seem blindingly obvious in hindsight. Thomas Jefferson 
owned slaves. Generations of enlightened men -- until just a couple of decades 
ago -- saw nothing wrong with a society where opportunities for women were 
circumscribed in ways that seem unbelievable today. Women still don't have 
equal opportunity, but almost no one denies that they're entitled to it. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush -- not an evil man, not a racist -- opposed the Civil Rights Act of 
1964. Today we argue about its interpretation, but outright opposition to the 
Civil Rights Act would put you on the distant fringes of political 
acceptability -- not in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
My point is not that America before the Civil Rights Act or the liberation of 
women was in any way comparable to the Soviet Union. My point is to reserve a 
bit of sympathy for people whose moral universe is suddenly turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>
America's basic values are not going to be found wanting and rejected 
overnight, as is happening in the Communist bloc. But who knows what perceptual 
revolution will come along that will make the views of even right-thinking 
people today seem shockingly debased? When it happens, most of us will flip 
just like those students at the Moscow Higher Party School.
