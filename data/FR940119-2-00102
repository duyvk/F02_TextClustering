Purpose and Scope 
The Applied Research and Technology (ART) Program, authorized under section 6005 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991, Pub. L. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914, 2170, was established to accelerate the testing
and evaluation of technologies, both domestic and foreign, which are designed to improve the physical and/or operating
characteristics of highways and transit and intermodal systems. These guidelines have been developed in direct
response to section 6005(a) of the ISTEA (codified at 23 U.S.C. 307(e)(2)) and apply to the field Test and Evaluation
(T&E) projects. The purpose of these guidelines is to set forth the FHWA's selection criteria of field T&E
projects for State highway agency construction projects. 
The field T&E projects are but one element of the FHWA's Applied Research and Technology Program. The other elements
include (1) the Applied Research Element, and (2) the Priority Technologies Element. The former includes support
for the development of research and development (R&D) products, the implementation of new technologies, international
activities, and the funding of the operation of HITEC. The latter includes the testing and evaluation of the designated
technologies that are specified in section 6005(e) (4)-(8) of ISTEA, and the other new and innovative technologies
identified by the FHWA and proposed for partnerships. 
Proposals for field T&E projects for ART Program funding are invited from State highway agencies, private entities,
individuals, and other organizations. All proposals will be routed through the Highway Innovative Technology Evaluation
Center (HITEC). HITEC, an independent non-profit organization, was created by the American Society of Civil Engineers'
(ASCE) Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF), in conjunction with the American Association of State Highway
and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). HITEC provides a process
for the impartial evaluation of new products, materials, equipment, and services for which industry standards do
not exist. Proposals for funding R&D and other activities not associated with the testing and evaluation of new
technologies will not be evaluated by HITEC. 
Applications will be processed by HITEC under its standard procedures for assessment, planning, evaluation, and
reporting on products, materials, equipment, services, and other technologies. HITEC will act as the central point
of screening of new technologies by the public and private sectors. Highway agencies are encouraged to have private
individuals submit their ideas and proprietary products directly to HITEC for screening and possible evaluation.
If the technology requires a full scale field T&E project, HITEC, by working with the States, will assist applicants
in developing and submitting evaluation plans for T&E projects to the FHWA for possible funding under the ART
Program. State highway agencies may also submit applications to HITEC for non-commercial technologies. The FHWA
will determine the acceptability of the project for funding.
 
For those technologies that result in State highway agency construction projects approved by the FHWA, the program
provides for ART funding of up to 80 percent to State highway agencies for the cost of installing (constructing) the
new technologies as part of a T&E project. In addition, the costs for testing, data collection, evaluation, and
report preparation associated with the T&E construction project are eligible for 100 percent ART funds. State
highway agencies conducting T&E projects are required to submit annual interim reports and a final report to
document the project, the data collected, and the testing and evaluation results. If the technology fails on an operating
highway, a pro rata share of the repair and/or replacement costs to restore the highway to useable condition may be
financed with Federal-aid funds for that system of highways. 
Applications 
Applications for technology testing and evaluation and possible ART T&E funding shall be submitted directly
to HITEC. Application requirements are intended to be simple, brief, and straightforward to encourage participation
by private innovators and others who are unfamiliar with the highway market.
 
HITEC has developed an Information and Application Booklet that has been designed to be a comprehensive, self-explanatory
document. It includes an Application Form as well as a description of the technical protocols and HITEC operating
policies. Written inquiries and applications should be addressed to: HITEC, 1015 15th Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20005. The phone number is (202) 842-0555. 
Technologies 
The definition of new technologies for testing and evaluation includes those that represent significant changes
in the performance or other relevant characteristics of an existing product, but not the minor upgrading of a product
or the use of the evaluation process to promote new interest in an existing product. Technologies should be sufficiently
developed to provide a specific product, system, or process (at least in a prototype stage) for evaluation without
further development. In addition, technologies should employ new materials, designs, manufactured products,
construction procedures, functional components, or other features that may provide improved service and/or operating
or physical characteristics in the highway or transit system. 
Both domestic and foreign technologies are eligible for testing and evaluation in the program. Note that Intelligent
Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) technologies are not eligible for this program. IVHS technologies are specifically
covered under IVHS programs administered by the Department of Transportation and other agencies; IVHS technologies
will be referred to those programs. T&E projects eligible for consideration in the program will include (but
will not be limited to) the following categories of technology: 
1. Accelerated Construction Materials and Procedures. Projects under this category will test and evaluate innovative
uses and modifications of concrete, steel, plastics, composites, and other materials, and innovative procedures
for accelerating construction, including specifications and equipment for pavements, structures, geotechnical
works, and drainage facilities. Rapid-curing materials, prefabricated components, plug-in replacement modules,
automated construction equipment, robots, and sensors are examples of technologies that will be 
considered in this category.
