NMFS proposes to take the 13-mt reduction in the U.S. quota from the 31 mt reserve, thereby continuing or slightly modifying
the 1992/1993 quota allocations. The following quota allocations would be established for 1994: General category_531
mt; Harpoon Boat category_53 mt; Purse Seine category_301 mt; Incidental Catch category_southern longline subcategory
quota of 86 mt, northern longline subcategory quota of 23 mt, and "other" subcategory quota of 4 mt; Angling category_219
mt (no more than 99 mt of this quota may be school bluefin of which 47 mt may be landed south of 38
&cir;47
&rsquo; N. latitude and 52 mt may be landed north of 38
&cir;47
&rsquo; N. latitude). The Angling category quota for school bluefin is reduced from 100 mt to 99 mt because it is based,
per ICCAT recommendation, on 8 percent of the total U.S. quota (including reserve), which is lower for 1994. 
Also at the November 1993 meeting, ICCAT recommended a quota of 1,200 mt for the western Atlantic for 1995 (of which
U.S. fishermen would receive 743 mt). This reduction of over 50 percent from the 1991 western Atlantic quota is based
upon scientific assessments that indicate that present harvest levels are resulting in a decrease in the size of the
western Atlantic bluefin stock. The relatively higher 1994 allocation resulted from a 1-year provision to allow
additional time for scientific research, a review of data and methodologies used in the western Atlantic bluefin
stock assessment, and to reduce the short-term economic impact on fishermen. As a member of ICCAT, the United States
is obligated to adopt domestic regulations to comply with these recommendations. This proposed rule would establish
quota allocations by fishing categories for 1994 only. The quota reduction for 1995, being of greater magnitude and
likely to have significant impacts on the human environment, will be addressed in future rulemaking, which will include
preparation and public review of an environmental impact statement. 
Change in Bycatch Conditions for Southern Longline Subcategory 
In 1982, ICCAT recommended a ban on a directed bluefin tuna fishery in the Gulf of Mexico spawning area out of concern
for protection of the spawning stock. NMFS examination of available longline fishery data regarding discarded bluefin
in the Gulf of Mexico revealed that more than 80 percent of those bluefin released were dead. Thus, in the interest of
reducing waste, NMFS allowed landing of bluefin tuna but implemented longline fishery restrictions to preclude
directed harvest. 
In a final rule dated January 26, 1981 (46 FR 8012), NMFS implemented an incidental catch limit of two giant bluefin
per trip in the area south of 36
&cir; N. latitude and 2 percent by weight of all other fish on board per trip in the area north of that latitude. The reason
for the disparity in the catch limits between the two regions was that the 2 percent by weight limit was believed to be
unenforceable in southern ports due to the lack of weighing facilities in many areas where bluefin were landed. On
January 6, 1992 (57 FR 365), NMFS determined that the incidental catch limit of two giant bluefin per trip in the southern
area was not effective at reducing bluefin bycatch and changed the restriction for this area to one bluefin per trip,
provided the vessel landed, offloaded, and sold at least 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) of other species. NMFS believed that
the majority of trips directed at other species met or exceeded the threshold, making accurate weighing unnecessary
in most cases. 
NMFS has received several comments indicating that the current bycatch restriction in the southern area is causing
an increase in bluefin discard and waste. Fishermen have reported that when a bluefin is caught early in a trip, they
are forced to continue fishing at the risk of deteriorating quality and price and at the risk of having to discard additional
bluefin in order to meet the target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg). Examination of 1993 domestic observer
data indicates that of 15 bluefin caught during observed trips, only four were retained (27 percent). Thus, reducing
the target catch requirement could lead to a reduction in bluefin mortality. 
NMFS examined several options, none of which would change the allocation for the total longline bycatch. The options
that were discussed at the scoping meetings were: (1) Require special gear; (2) set a requirement of a minimum number
of days between a vessel's landings; and (3) revise the minimum target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg). Recommendations
also included prohibiting bluefin catches in the spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico or, conversely, to work through
ICCAT to rescind the prohibition and establish a limited directed fishery. 
Special gear restrictions, such as breakaway leaders and circle hooks, are a management option, but further study
is required to define exact specifications and enforcement methods. NMFS considered setting a minimum number of
days between allowable landing of a bluefin by individual vessels but rejected this option because it could foster
a periodic directed fishery for bluefin while not necessarily eliminating the problems of bluefin bycatch on longline
trips directed at yellowfin tuna, swordfish, or sharks. NMFS also considered prohibiting the landing of bluefin
by longliners during the spawning season in the Gulf of Mexico but rejected this option because it would have precluded
retention of unavoidable bycatch that in many cases could not be released alive. NMFS also rejected a limited directed
fishery, which would be inconsistent with the ICCAT recommendation. Given the depleted status of the bluefin resource
and the significance of the Gulf of Mexico spawning grounds, NMFS does not consider a directed fishery to be warranted
at this time. 
NMFS believes that requiring threshold amounts to be landed ensures that bluefin are harvested only as bycatch incidental
to fishing for other species. NMFS examined landings of Gulf of Mexico longline trips where no bluefin were taken to
determine if the current target catch requirement of 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) is appropriate. The data indicate that for
years 1989 through 1991, the median values of landings for trips where no bluefin were sold were slightly above 1,500
lbs (680 kg) for the months of January through April, and about 3,500 lbs (1,588 kg) for the months of May through December.
Therefore, NMFS proposes to amend the minimum poundage requirement so that for the southern management area for the
Incidental Catch category one bluefin tuna may be landed per vessel per fishing trip, provided that for the months
of January through April at least 1,500 lbs (680 kg) and for the months of May through December at least 3,500 lbs (1,588
kg), either dressed or round weight, of species other than Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught, retained, and
offloaded from the same trip and are recorded on the dealer weighout as sold. This change should reduce waste and mortality
of bluefin tuna, while preserving the quality and value of legitimate bluefin bycatch that is landed.
