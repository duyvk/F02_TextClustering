These days, eating can seem like serious business, what with fretting about 
fiber and chafing over cholesterol. For a breather, step back in time. Test 
your knowledge of fascinating food facts and fancies with this quiz: 
</P>
<P>
Question: Convenience foods seem like a 20th-Century invention, but what were 
the first ones? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Fermented milk and cheese are often considered early convenience foods. 
On a more exotic note, more than 2,000 years ago the Chinese prized dried snake 
as a portable food for long trips, while Indians traveled with dried rice and 
dried bummelo fish, curiously labeled "Bombay duck." The Tibetan combination of 
yak butter and tea leaves also served well on trips. More recently, the 
portable staple for sailors was hardtack, made of flour and water, then baked 
rock-hard. 
</P>

Q: The modern eggplant looks nothing like an egg. How did it get its name? 
</P>
<P>
A: The only link we can find is shape, dating back to when eggplants were grown 
for decorative purposes. Actually, only Americans use that name, the British 
preferring the French word aubergine. That word can be traced to the Sanskrit, 
meaning "anti-wind" vegetable. Eggplant became a favorite of what might loosely 
be described as hippies and beautiful people in late 18th-Century France. 
Earlier it had been blamed falsely for causing epilepsy and fever. 
</P>
<P>
Q: At one time, tomatoes were considered poisonous fruit. How did that lore get 
started? 
</P>
<P>
A: Early botanists recognized the tomato, along with potatoes and eggplants, as 
members of the same family of poisonous plants as belladonna and black henbane. 
In 1544, Italian botanist Pierandrea Mattioli initially named the tomato mala 
aurea, meaning "golden apple" (the first ones to reach Europe were yellow), but 
later renamed it mala insana, or "unhealthy apple." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Oats have enjoyed a meteoric rise in reputation as a "health food." We 
associate them with Scotland, but where did oats originate? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oats, it appears, forced themselves on the world's diet. Perhaps having 
first taken root in northern Germany, they were already being eaten, possibly 
in wild form, in northern Europe in Neolithic times. By the Bronze Age, oats 
were under cultivation in central Europe. In ancient times, growing as weeds in 
high, cool altitudes, they choked out wheat, so farmers gave up and harvested 
them instead. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Numerous studies have explored the effects of coffee on health, but 
clear-cut links have yet to be found. In times past, coffee was valued for its 
special benefits. What were they? 
</P>
<P>
A: Coffee is said to have achieved its initial popularity among a religious 
sect known as dervishes, whose ritual included chanting and continuous whirling 
until participants slipped into a trance. Caffeine in the coffee may have 
prolonged the precataleptic state. Coffee originated in Ethiopia, but it's not 
known who first realized it was edible and drinkable. The word derives from 
both Turkish and Arabic roots meaning "wine." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Cocoa trees, native to South America, were probably brought to Europe by the 
crew of Columbus' fourth voyage. Cocoa was consumed as a beverage first, 
chocolate in block form came later. When was it first made into bars? 
</P>
<P>
A: For nearly 300 years after it was introduced in Europe, chocolate was 
consumed only in drinks. Chocolate bars appeared in Europe in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Q: While olive oil has been a valued food since ancient times, it has other 
uses too. Can you name some of them? 
</P>
<P>
A: Before soap was invented, olive oil was used as a cleanser. In ancient 
Egypt, it may have been used as a lubricant to help move the huge blocks of 
stone forming the pyramids. The ancient Greeks and Hebrews applied it to the 
skin to bestow health and longevity. 
</P>
<P>
As a fuel, it was burned in earthenware lamps. The pulp remaining after the oil 
was pressed was used as animal feed and fertilizer. The Romans used the 
leftover liquid both as a weed killer and as insecticide on cabbage. Wood from 
olive trees was used for various purposes, notably the tabernacle of Solomon's 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Pasta's popularity has soared in recent years. Everyone knows the story that 
even though it's the keystone of Italian cooking, it was brought back from 
China by Marco Polo. But was it really? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to Reay Tannahill, author of "Food and History" (Crown Publishers: 
1988), that idea is a mistranslation of his having said that he "discovered" 
that the Chinese had pasta "which are like ours." The Italian pasta may date 
back to Etruscan times. If so, that would predate Chinese noodles by roughly 
500 years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Tannahill's book, for more fun reading about food, try Waverly Root's 
"Food: An Authorized and Visual History"; Harold McGee's "On Food and Cooking: 
The Science and Lore of the Kitchen"; both Jane Grigson's "Vegetable Book" and 
"Fruit Book"; "Food in Chinese Culture" by K.C. Chang, and "Savoring the Past" 
by Barbara Wheaton.

From Dickens to Modern Doctors: No One Is Exact About Dyspepsia 
</P>
<P>
Question: I've often wondered -- especially when reading old novels, where it 
seems to be a common affliction -- exactly what the term "dyspepsia" means. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You're not the only one. The name derives from two Greek words, dys, 
"bad," and pepsis, "digestion." Hence, bad digestion. That meaning is far too 
broad, since digestion covers everything from chewing to defecation. With 
dyspepsia, the focus is on the upper gastrointestinal tract and can include a 
laundry list of symptoms such as upper-abdominal pain or discomfort, unusual 
fullness after meals, feeling too full early in a meal, loss of appetite, 
belching, nausea and vomiting, and heartburn or regurgitation. 
</P>
<P>
That's why we say you're not the only one who's wondered how to define the 
condition. Attempting to reach a consensus, a group of physicians formed the 
"International Working Party on the Definition and Investigation of Dyspepsia" 
(some party). Here's their definition: "episodic or persistent abdominal 
symptoms, often related to feeding, which patients or physicians believe to be 
due to disorders of the proximal (upper) portion of the digestive tract." They 
suggest that it's a more useful term if accompanied by modifiers, as in "ulcer 
dyspepsia" or "nonulcer dyspepsia." 
</P>
<P>
Dyspeptic symptoms may be linked to structural problems of the gastrointestinal 
tract, use of drugs or alcohol, or metabolic diseases. With the possible 
exception of milk intolerance, it's rare to be able to prove objectively that a 
particular food is responsible for dyspepsia. 
</P>
<P>
Dyspepsia can also occur in individuals in whom no disease can be identified. 
This common problem is generally called functional dyspepsia. Did the 
dyspeptics of Dickens' novels suffer from functional disease, from extra-tight 
corsets, or from food-borne illnesses caused by foods poorly cooked and 
improperly stored? We'll never know for sure. 
</P>

Q: I had to go back to work soon after my son was born. I considered 
breast-feeding, but it was logistically impossible. My baby is healthy but 
sometimes fussy. My pediatrician says that's normal, but a friend who was 
visiting suggested I switch to iron-free formula. She claims that the addition 
of iron to formula can cause discomfort in some babies. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
A: As a parent, you'll receive lots of free advice from friends, well-meant but 
not always accurate or helpful. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics found no 
scientific evidence that infants who consume iron-fortified formulas are more 
likely to suffer colic, constipation, diarrhea or regurgitation than those on 
nonfortified formula. The only difference observed, in one study where infants 
were fed both types of formula, were darker stools when the babies received the 
iron. That is of no importance. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also addressed another concern: that iron-fortified formula might 
interfere with absorption of zinc and copper. Again, they found no evidence 
that any impairment of absorption is nutritionally important, given the levels 
of both those minerals in the formula. 
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, by 1985, iron-fortified formula represented 80% of 
all formula sold in the United States, up from 40% in 1971. This trend is 
believed to be a major factor in the decline of anemia among infants in this 
country, among both low-income and middle-class populations. Their conclusion: 
Given the demonstrated benefit and lack of evidence for untoward effect, 
iron-fortified formula should be used for all formula-fed infants. 
</P>

Q: Oh bacon, bacon, I used to eat you often, but now, only on special 
occasions. My question is this: I know that in times past, cured meats were 
stored for long periods. But in that era, food safety was not well understood. 
Just how long is it safe to keep bacon? 
</P>
<P>
A: Begin by checking the package. As long as the bacon remains sealed in a 
vacuum package and looks well-colored, it should be just fine as much as a week 
after the last date of sale. Once opened, though, it should be wrapped tightly 
and kept no longer than a week. For longer storage it should be frozen, but not 
too long. After about a month the fat starts to turn rancid. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most efficient way to freeze bacon is to precook it until it's not 
quite done. Then drain it well, wrap it in paper towels, and then in heavy 
freezer material. It can then be stored in the freezer up to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
An important difference in curing methods allowed people in earlier days to 
keep cured meats over an entire winter. Today's cured meats, mildly cured and 
moist, generally are prepared for flavor rather than longevity. Those earlier 
meats were heavily salted and well dried, allowing them to keep through winter 
and beyond.
