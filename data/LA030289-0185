Just like the 1950s-era diners it tries to emulate, the Busy Bee Cafe in 
downtown Ventura sports decals on its front window advertising, "Malts, 
Burgers, Shakes, Sodas, Chili, Sundaes." 
</P>
<P>
And like so many diners of that period did, the Busy Bee boasts, in six-inch 
block letters painted so that snow appears to have fallen atop them, that the 
cafe is "Air Conditioned." 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1950s, Ventura had no Architectural Review Board and no ordinance 
regulating commercial signs. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the city takes a dim view of ersatz "American Graffiti" decor along 
historic Main Street. Much to the chagrin of owner Ed Warren, who opened the 
popular restaurant 1 1/2 years ago, officials have ordered the signs removed as 
too large and too garish. 
</P>
<P>
"If this were on any old street in any old town, it wouldn't be that bad," said 
David Sargent, one of three architects on the city's seven-member Architectural 
Review Board. "But, as it is, it's the only building on that particular street 
with those particular graphics and it sticks out." 
</P>
<P>
Warren, who has collected about 300 signatures from customers in preparation 
for his appeal at a March 27 meeting of the board, called the order arbitrary 
and confusing. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the signs blend in nicely," he said. "They contribute to the feel and 
the ambiance of the place. . . . I don't understand exactly what they're trying 
to tell me." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the question of whether the malt signs will stay, however, the dispute 
strikes an increasingly familiar refrain in Ventura, where there are few 
aesthetic guidelines to help developers meet the constant cries to preserve 
small-town charm. 
</P>
<P>
Although such design standards are to be discussed when the City Council 
reviews Ventura's general plan later this year, officials in the meantime often 
make subjective judgments about a project's style, regardless of its other 
merits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Project Turned Down 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, for instance, the council rejected an upscale three-unit 
condominium project that, even though it met virtually all city zoning 
standards, was considered too tall and bulky to stand next to a quaint, 
European-style inn on the same downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be an arbitrary decision," said Fred Goodrich, an associate city 
planner who assists the Architectural Review Board. "It just isn't written in 
the book, what is good design." 
</P>
<P>
Warren, who owned the cafe, then called Warren's, from 1963 to 1978, thought 
that he had found a good design when he bought back his restaurant in 1987 and 
adopted the 1950s-era style that was sweeping trendy diners in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But in a routine inspection of the Busy Bee in May, a city code enforcement 
officer found that Warren did not have the needed permits for any of the signs 
on the building facade. 
</P>
<P>
Warren applied for and the Architectural Review Board approved a neon rendition 
of the cafe's namesake that hangs above the storefront. But the funky soda shop 
decals had to go, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
A city code limits the total area of signs on commercial buildings to one 
square foot for every foot of storefront, which, for the Busy Bee, translated 
into 26 square feet of signs. Of that, however, only 20% can be used for 
product advertisement, the law says. And the decals along the bottom of 
Warren's window occupy 19 square feet, or about four times as much window as 
they should have. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Denied 
</P>
<P>
Warren went to the Architectural Review Board in October asking for an 
exemption, but was told that the signs were just "too much" for his storefront 
and the neighborhood, Goodrich said. 
</P>
<P>
On a drive down Main Street, one can find numerous signs more obtrusive than 
Warren's decals, including the likeness of a large Arabian genie hoisting the 
name of a carpet store above his head, a multicolored hot-air balloon atop a 
furniture store announcing a going-out-of-business sale, and even a big, ragged 
banner advertising a sale on color film printing at a camera store next door to 
the Busy Bee. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, however, explain that they do not have the manpower to enforce sign 
standards at every business in the city. Moreover, they say, some of the 
gaudiest signs were in place before Ventura adopted its sign ordinance in 1971. 
And, they add, temporary banners fall into a special category, which permits 
them to fly for 90 days a year as long as they're not up for more than 30 
consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
"There are ugly signs all over the city," Sargent said. "As we have the time 
and personnel to deal with them, we do. . . . The Busy Bee is better looking 
than a lot of storefronts on Main Street and just not as good as some others."
