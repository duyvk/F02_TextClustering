THE public spending round to accompany the introduction of next month's
unified Budget is nearly complete. After two months of wrangling the full
cabinet will today begin taking some real decisions.
There are one or two more rows to come. Under the new system the important
players around the cabinet table are unwilling to settle their budgets until
the last moment.
The neat theory that the creation of a cabinet committee - the so-called EDX
 -to thrash out the government's priorities would speed up the process has
proved to be wishful thinking. Collective decision-making has its price.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will be at the head of a queue
arguing that big spending cuts must fall elsewhere. He will be carrying with
him, of course, the letter to Mr John Major from 14 Tory MPs threatening a
backbench rebellion if the Treasury gets its way.
Mr Peter Lilley, Mr David Hunt, Mrs Virginia Bottomley and Mr John MacGregor
will be among others appealing to the collective good sense of their
colleagues. Even the urbane Mr Douglas Hurd wants a full hearing.
But if not today, then by next week the cabinet will agree a set of figures
which will meet the remit set in July for public spending to be more or less
frozen in real terms for the next three years.
To do anything else would be to undermine fatally the notion that Mr Kenneth
Clarke is serious about tackling the public sector borrowing requirement.
And whatever the success of last minute appeals to the full cabinet, it is
clear just where the axe will cut most deeply.
The Treasury has already announced that all Whitehall budgets will be fixed
on the heroic assumption that public-sector pay will not rise at all in cash
terms next year.
Teachers, nurses, policeman and civil servants are thus expected to take a
cut in living standards. In reality ministers know that most of them will
get a pay increase - at the expense of higher public-sector unemployment.
But the ministers who joined Mr Clarke in the deliberations of EDX decided
at the outset they had no other choice. Without a pay freeze the numbers
would not add up.
One participant was reminded of the hoary joke about the economist stranded
on a desert island with cases and cases of food but nothing to open them
with. The economist 'assumed' a can-opener.
Other assumptions made when the process started back in June have
disappeared already in harsh political realities. EDX, it was said, would
get to grips with the inexorable rise in the Pounds 80bn social security
budget - representing nearly a third of all public spending.
Instead social security will emerge as one of the biggest 'winners' of the
negotiations. True, Mr Lilley will be taking some harsh measures to curb the
growth of invalidity benefit payments. There may also be a fierce clampdown
on fraud and, probably, new restrictions on benefit payments to cover
mortgage interest.
But the combination of a precarious Commons majority and a series of
manifesto pledges has allowed the rightwing social security security to
defend most of his programmes.
The Treasury cannot count the number of times Mr Lilley has responded to a
demand for the means-testing of child benefit or cuts in unemployment
benefit with: 'It would never get through the Commons'.
So the social security budget - along with those for legal aid and
agricultural support payments - will continue to rise in real terms. So too
will those of health and education - though at a slower rate and at the cost
of accepting a few more heroic assumptions about efficiency gains.
Health is protected by a manifesto pledge, education because it was once Mr
Major's big idea.
Instead the main victims of EDX have been the traditional 'soft' targets for
all governments: capital spending on housing and roads, the local authority
grant settlement, inner city regeneration schemes and, for all Mr Rifkind's
protests, defence.
The participants have also discovered something else. The term unified
budget is a misnomer. For all the talk of bringing together spending and
revenue decisions, the Treasury has not allowed any discussion of the
trade-off between the two sides of the balance sheet. It is perhaps not
surprising that some ministers believe the whole concept of a unified budget
will not long outlive its creator, Mr Norman Lamont.
