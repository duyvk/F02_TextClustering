The ESA does not use the term "fish and wildlife habitat" in the definition of critical habitat. Instead, the ESA
only refers to geographic areas with physical or biological features that are essential for the species. The ESA also
defines the term "species" as including "any subspecies of fish or wildlife or 
plants
, and any distinct population segment of any species or vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature"
(Emphasis added). 
The proposed Wyoming definition of critical habitat appears to exclude plants. Also, Wyoming has not specified any
State statutes or rules that identify State critical habitat or Threatened and Endangered Species as required by
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16. Additionally, OSM cannot determine whether the term "fish and wildlife
habitat" in this definition means fish and wildlife habitat for ESA purposes or fish and wildlife habitat as a land
use. Finally, Wyoming also recognizes critical habitat designated by the "Secretary of Commerce." It is not clear
if this requirement is in addition to the Secretary of the Interior's designation or is an option to use the "Secretary
of Commerce" designation instead of the Secretary of Interior's. 
Therefore, based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the proposed statutory definition at W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxix)
is not in accordance with and is less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving the proposed
definition. Wyoming is required to either repeal this statutory definition or modify it to be in accordance with and
no less effective than the Federal program requirements. 
3. W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxx): Definition of Important and Crucial Habitat 
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxx) a definition as follows: 
(xxx) "Important habitat" or "crucial habitat" means that fish and wildlife habitat, exclusive of agricultural
lands, which in limited availability, increases the species diversity of a localized area and fulfills one (1) or
more of the essential living requirements of important wildlife species.
Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations include a definition of important habitat or crucial habitat.
However, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780/784.16(a)(2) requires permit applications to include site-specific
resource information when the permit area or adjacent area is likely to include "habitats of unusually high value
for fish and wildlife such as streams, wetlands, riparian areas, cliffs supporting raptors, areas offering special
shelter or protection, migration routes, or reproduction and wintering areas." 
These habitats of unusually high value would appear to be comparable to the State proposed definition for important
or crucial habitat. Additionally, the State regulations at LQD Rule Chapter II, Section 2(a)(i)(E)(II) require
permit applications to include specific information "if critical or important habitat or migration route disruption
is likely." Wyoming's LQD Rule at Chapter II, Section 3(b)(iv)(B) is similar to the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780.16(b)(3)(ii)
in requiring protection and enhancement of "important habitat for fish and wildlife, such as wetlands, riparian
areas, rimrocks, areas offering special shelter or protection, reproduction and nursery areas, and wintering areas."
However, the Federal permitting and performance standard regulations do not exclude any land uses from consideration
in meeting the requirements for protection and enhancement. Wetlands, riparian areas, migration and wintering
areas can potentially occur within any land use including grazingland, pastureland, forestry, etc. Wyoming's proposed
definition would appear to exclude consideration of important habitat or crucial habitat from those land uses included
in the categorical definition of "agricultural lands." These would include the land uses of cropland, pastureland,
hayland and grazingland.
