Section 10305(d) of OBRA 1989 amended section 223(g)(2)(B) 
of the Act to require that the Secretary take into account any 
physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations an 
individual may have (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) in determining whether an individual's appeal 
is made in good faith. 
Based on this amendment and the amendment to title XVI of 
the Act made by section 10305(e) of OBRA 1989, we are amending 
Sect.Sect.404.1597a(j)(3) and 416.996(g)(2) to provide that we will take 
into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) the individual has in determining whether the 
individual acted in good faith in pursuing the appeal. 
&bull;Determinations of Good Cause or of Fraud or Similar 
Fault in Connection With the Administrative Review Process 
Section 10305(e) amended section 1631(c)(1) of the Act to 
provide that the Secretary shall specifically take into account 
any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations of 
an individual (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) in determining, with respect to the eligibility of the 
individual for benefits under title XVI, whether the individual 
acted in good faith or was at fault, and in determining fraud, 
deception, or intent. 
The changes we are making in part 416 of the regulations in 
connection with the administrative review process are based on 
the amendment to section 1631(c)(1). We are making comparable 
changes in part 404 in the interest of consistency. 
Our current regulations provide that a determination or 
decision which we make about an individual's rights under title 
II or title XVI of the Act is generally final and binding unless 
the individual files a request for review of the determination or 
decision within a specified time period. However, the time 
period to request review will be extended if good cause can be 
established for missing the deadline to request review 
(Sect.Sect.404.911 and 416.1411). Also, under our regulations, we may 
reopen a determination or decision at any time if it was obtained 
by fraud or similar fault (Sect.Sect.404.988(c)(1) and 416.1488(c)), or, 
in title II cases, if certain other circumstances exist 
(Sect.404.988(c)). 
Under our regulations, a request for a hearing before an ALJ 
may be dismissed if neither the person requesting the hearing nor 
his or her designated representative appears at the time and 
place set for the hearing. However, if good cause for failure to 
appear can be established, the hearing request will not be 
dismissed (Sect.Sect.404.957(b) and 416.1457(b)). 
We are making the following changes to Sect.Sect.404.911, 404.936, 
404.957, 404.988, 416.1411, 416.1436, 416.1457, and 416.1488 to 
reflect the consideration of the factors described in section 
10305 of OBRA 1989. 
&bull;Amend Sect.Sect.404.911(a) and (b)(9) and 416.1411(a) and (b)(9) to 
provide that in determining whether an individual had good cause 
for missing a deadline to request review, we will take into 
account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations of the individual (including any lack of facility 
with the English language) which may have prevented the 
individual from filing a timely request or from understanding or 
knowing about the need to file a timely request for review. 
&bull;Amend Sect.Sect.404.936 and 416.1436 to further describe 
circumstances which an individual, who will not be represented at 
a hearing before an ALJ, may give for requesting a change in the 
time or place of the hearing. 
&bull;Amend Sect.Sect.404.957(b) and 416.1457(b) to require that in 
making determinations of whether an individual had good cause for 
failure to appear for a hearing before an ALJ, we will take into 
account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) the individual has.
