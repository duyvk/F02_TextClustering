Listing Factors and Basis for Determination
Under section 4(a)(1) of the ESA, a species can be determined to be endangered or threatened for any of the following
reasons: (1) Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (2) overutilization
for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4) inadequacy of
existing regulatory mechanisms; or (5) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. In addition,
under section 4(b)(7) of the ESA, the Secretary of Commerce may at any time issue an emergency regulation if there exists
a significant risk to the well-being of the species. In such a case, the Secretary must publish a Federal Register notice
detailing the reasons for an emergency listing. Listing determinations are made solely on the best scientific and
commercial data available.
Biological Information Solicited
To ensure that the coho salmon status review is complete and is based on the best available scientific and commercial
data, NMFS is soliciting information and comments concerning: (1) Whether or not the populations qualify as "species"
under the ESA in accordance with NMFS' "Policy on Applying the Definition of Species Under the Endangered Species
Act to Pacific Salmon" (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991); and (2) whether or not the populations are endangered or threatened
based on the above listing criteria. Specifically, NMFS is soliciting information in the following areas: Influence
of historical and present hatchery fish releases on naturally spawning populations of coho salmon, separation of
hatchery and natural coho salmon escapement, alteration of coho salmon freshwater and marine habitats, disease
epizootiology of coho salmon, age structure of coho salmon populations, migration timing and behavior of juvenile
and adult coho salmon, and interactions of coho salmon with other salmonids. This information should address all
coho salmon populations in California, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington (including Puget Sound). Because a very similar
request for information was published in the 
Federal Register
 (58 FR 57770, October 27, 1993) announcing NMFS' decision to conduct a review of West Coast coho salmon populations,
it is not necessary for parties to submit the same information for this request. Copies of the petition are available
(see 
ADDRESSES
).
Critical Habitat
NMFS is also requesting information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for California, Oregon, Idaho,
and Washington populations of coho salmon. Areas that include the physical and biological features essential to
the recovery of the species should be identified. Areas outside the present range should also be identified if such
areas are essential to the recovery of the species. Essential features should include, but are not limited to: (1)
Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; (2) food, water, air, light, minerals, or other
nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter; (4) sites for reproduction and rearing of offspring;
and (5) habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological
distributions of the species.
