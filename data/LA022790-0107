Last fall's biological warfare experiment against the ash whitefly, which has 
attacked trees in at least 15 California counties, was successful in killing 
the destructive pests, researchers reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
However, ash whitefly experts said they need more money to continue the 
research that could provide a long-term solution to the ash whitefly problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We could really be set back if the University of California was unable to 
continue its research," said Peter J. Stoddard, statewide coordinator for the 
Department of Food and Agriculture's ash whitefly project. "It's kind of hard 
to keep ahead of this insect." 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture departments throughout Southern California, including Orange 
County's, have funded the research. But agricultural commissioners said funding 
also needs to come from other parts of California because the problem has 
become statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Resendez, a Southern California spokesman for the Nursery Growers Assn. 
of California, said his group plans to lobby state legislators for additional 
support. "It's really important to our industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fight against the ash whitefly is being waged with imported parasitic 
wasps, one of the whitefly's natural enemies. About 300 wasps were dispersed in 
small groups last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps destroy the fly either by attacking it or implanting it with eggs 
that consume the fly from the inside out as the egg matures. 
</P>
<P>
The microscopic wasps, which do not grow stingers, have been the best weapon 
against the pinhead-size flies, which have been unaffected by pesticides since 
being discovered in Southern California 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bellows, a UC Riverside entomologist who is heading the biological 
eradication research team, said the researchers were "very pleased" with the 
wasps' performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Food and Agriculture, in joint effort with the UC Riverside 
researchers, plans to disperse thousands of additional wasps this spring in a 
full-scale attack against the flies. The pest, which attacks trees by sucking 
the juice from leaves, has so far affected apple, peach, pear, plum, apricot, 
pomegranate, lime and kumquat trees. 
</P>
<P>
But Bellows warned against relying solely on the wasps to wipe out the billions 
of flies in the Southland. He encouraged the development of additional natural 
enemies of the flies, such as an imported beetle, which are currently being 
studied at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot that we don't know about the natural enemy of this bug," he 
said. "It will take repreated and consistent effort."
