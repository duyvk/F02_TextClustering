THE European Community car industry will have to sacrifice jobs, cut working
hours and introduce new training methods and working patterns if it is to
compete with US and Japanese manufacturers, the EC's industry commissioner
said yesterday.
Mr Martin Bangemann told a Turin conference on the future of the EC car
industry that the Commission would encourage training and re-training, and
back technological innovation to help improve the competitiveness of the car
industry.
Mr Bangemann also called for the development of an EC-wide computerised
road-pricing system, which would replace toll-kiosks on main European
highways, and help reduce congestion and pollution. 'We do not abolish
frontiers in Europe just to see ourselves forced to stop every few
kilometres to pay a toll,' he said in his speech, the text of which was
released in Brussels.
The Commission has just submitted to member states a draft of its latest
report on the state of the EC car industry. Industry ministers will discuss
the study at their meeting on November 18 and Commission officials said
yesterday they expected several weeks of fierce political debate about how
the EC should respond to the industry's problems. A final report is likely
to be adopted in early 1994. In his speech yesterday, Mr Bangemann urged the
industry to invest in new plants with the aim of creating a European 'lean
production' system as productive and cost-efficient as the Japanese
equivalent.
But he added that there would also have to be changes to the internal
organisation of companies and to their relationship with outside partners,
component manufacturers and the sales network.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, is in Brussels today to cajole
the EC's industry and competition commissioners into agreeing plans for the
future of Ekostahl, the east German steelmaker.
The Treuhand privatisation agency wants Riva, the private Italian
steelmaker, to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the construction
of a hot-rolling mill.
But Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is understood to be
insisting on further cuts in capacity at Ekostahl to offset the addition of
the new mill. Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, who is in charge of
industry policy, are keen to limit state subsidies to publicly owned
steelmakers.
