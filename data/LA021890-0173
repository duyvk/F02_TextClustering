Build a better mousetrap, and the world may beat a path to your door. 
</P>
<P>
But breed a brilliant cotton, and you're in for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Sally Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, 34, has revived the ancient Incan science of growing naturally colored 
cotton -- a fluffy fiber that bursts from its bolls in shades of brown and 
green and, she hopes someday soon, pinks and blues. Customers already are 
lining up to buy as much as she can grow. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, the state of California won't let her grow very much of it. And 
in the future, it may not let her grow any at all. 
</P>
<P>
To defend its reputation for growing some of the best cotton in the country, 
California has a strict "one-variety" rule that is enforced by the Acala Cotton 
Board. That regulation lets the established growers who sit on the board use 
the force of law to forbid competitors to grow any cotton other than the Acala 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
Acala is a brilliant white "medium-staple" variety of cotton -- that is, it has 
long, fine, strong fibers that spin easily into thread. Acala also is easily 
dyed and grows well in the soil and weather conditions of the southern San 
Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The one-variety rule was bent last year to accommodate growers who are rushing 
to plant an even finer cotton variety called Pima. But the cotton board voted 9 
to 3 late last year against a similar exemption that would let Fox grow 
commercial quantities of her new colored cotton. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's cotton has shorter, weaker fibers than Acala. The cotton board fears that 
if too much colored cotton is planted in California, it may mix with Acala, 
reducing its whiteness or fiber quality and hurting the state's reputation 
among buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Fox -- supported by other growers and researchers -- disputes this. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton board decisions "are destroying my business," sighed Fox, who has a 
graduate degree in entomology, the study of insects, and who started breeding 
colored cotton as a hobby in 1982. She added, "It's very frustrating, and not 
very smart." 
</P>
<P>
Squeezed between the Acala Cotton Board, which says it cannot by law permit 
anybody to plant what it argues is an inferior variety on more than a 160-acre 
test plot, and a growing customer list that includes amateur weavers and giant 
corporations, Fox said she may have to leave California, the country's 
second-largest cotton producing state. 
</P>
<P>
It is, she said, as if the state allowed IBM to tell Apple Computer that it was 
not welcome in California because its proposed new product might upset the 
established market. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, the country's leading cotton state, is wooing Fox with technical aid and 
grant offers, and she test-planted 80 acres outside Lubbock last year. But Fox, 
a fourth-generation Californian, said she prefers to find a way to remain 
working, living and experimenting in the small San Joaquin Valley farm town of 
Wasco, about 27 miles northwest of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
From there, on a typewriter perched in the living room of the modest rented 
house that serves as headquarters for Fox's one-person company, Natural Cotton 
Colours Inc., she appealed the cotton board's Nov. 28 decision to deny her 
request to plant 2,000 acres of colored cotton. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Voss, director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said Jan. 
5 that neither he nor Gov. George Deukmejian would reverse the decision of the 
established growers who sit on the board. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, the cotton board voted to let Fox continue growing only on her 
160-acre "test plot." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do," Fox said. "Some people said I should wait for the 
state to change its mind -- or its law -- but others say I have a head start 
and I should move and take advantage of it (by going to Texas) rather than let 
someone catch up to me." 
</P>
<P>
Independent cotton breeders and federal cotton researchers credit Fox with 
making colored cotton commercially viable by cross-breeding it with other 
varieties to improve its fibers. That made the cotton compatible with new, 
high-speed, automated spinning machines. 
</P>
<P>
Fox appreciates the accolades but said the cotton board's decision stops her 
from enjoying the fruits of her research -- and could let other, better 
capitalized growers catch up to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be miles ahead of the field," she said, "but they won't let me." 
</P>
<P>
Several other growers in Buttonwillow, Visalia and other San Joaquin Valley 
cotton towns said they support Fox, but they declined to go on the record for 
fear of offending the cotton board, which also regulates their operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It (colored cotton) doesn't reduce the quality of California cotton -- and 
that's been proven," one man said. He said that when managed properly, colored 
cotton "doesn't cross-breed (with white cotton), it doesn't contaminate the 
gins, it doesn't do anything bad." 
</P>
<P>
"We grow all kinds of specialty niche crops here in California -- kiwis and I 
don't know what else," the grower continued. "California is famous for it. But 
they won't allow this. It's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Cotton board members say they have no choice. California's one-variety law 
flatly prohibits the introduction of "inferior" varieties. While some people 
may argue that color makes Fox's cotton superior in one sense, the board said 
tests show its fiber quality just doesn't measure up to Acala. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Norman Clark, a cotton grower, said the board may ask the 
Legislature this year to amend the law to permit "niche" varieties such as 
Fox's. Without that, he said, the board may have to withdraw all permission for 
colored cotton. 
</P>
<P>
"They (board members) are really breaking the rules by letting her grow any 
colored cotton here at all," he said. "The law says that breeders with test 
plots here are supposed to work on new Acala varieties, and hers aren't." 
</P>
<P>
Fox became interested in colored cotton while she was living in San Diego and 
pursuing her hobby of hand-spinning yarn. She chose to investigate colored 
cotton as a potential cash crop when other hand-spinners also displayed 
interest in the curious material. Word of mouth about her colored cotton spread 
so fast among her friends and their friends that she started selling it by 
mail. That mail-order business now supports her while she tries to develop a 
broader market. 
</P>
<P>
The Palo Alto native and Peace Corps veteran, while working on non-chemical 
agricultural pest-control methods at a San Diego laboratory, set up a nascent 
base in Kern County by driving up to Wasco on weekends and bunking down with 
friends while tending one-acre test plots. 
</P>
<P>
She initially planted brown seeds given to her by a former employer, also a 
cotton breeder, and expected to see one consistent shade of brown cotton lint. 
Instead, she saw tans and medium browns, a sage green and even a weak pink. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought, 'Oh, no. There goes my business,"' she said. "Well, 
actually, I was really excited. All the colors! It was like nothing else I had 
ever seen -- or even heard about." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Fox's desire to stay in the southern San Joaquin Valley is that the 
area is naturally low in cotton crop pests. This makes it easier to pursue her 
parallel dream of producing "organic" cotton -- that is, cotton grown without 
pesticides or the defoliants that have become so controversial in California's 
cotton country. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to producing colored lint, the cotton varieties being developed by 
Fox have retained much of the inherent insect resistance of their semi-wild 
ancestors. She said this reduces, and may someday eliminate, the need for 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the colored lint is less easily ruined by green stains it can pick up 
from its own leaves when both pass through a mechanical harvester. This 
eliminates the need for the costly and controversial defoliation that growers 
now use to strip cotton plants of their leaves before harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Such features obviously were not of concern to the Incas who developed colored 
cotton centuries ago. Anthropologists believe they developed the colors for the 
same reason people today dye white cotton: decoration. But the colored 
varieties were forgotten as merchants perfected dyes, which came in more colors 
and allowed greater flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
A University of Texas anthropology student helped revive interest in colored 
cotton when he brought back samples of it from Peru in 1981. He discovered 
colored cotton after admiring, and being told the source of, the naturally 
colored clothes of Peruvian peasants. 
</P>
<P>
University of Arizona scientist Lee Stith said Fox, whose work he and his 
colleagues have watched with interest, is the first person in the United States 
he knows of who grows colored cotton commercially. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a neat little product that really caught the hearts of the people 
working here," said John Price, assistant director of Texas Tech University's 
Textile Research Center, which Fox hired to test her fiber for strength, color 
and "spinability," or the ability to be made into thread and cloth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the best in the world," Price said, "but its appeal is that it is a 
naturally colored cotton, and any defects (in cloth made from it) are 
relatively minor and academic." 
</P>
<P>
Fox is working to improve her cotton by breeding it with Sea Island and Acala 
varieties. In that way, she hopes to improve her cotton's fiber quality, which 
is critical in deciding its ultimate acceptability among growers. 
</P>
<P>
A more difficult hurdle with established growers is convincing them why anyone 
would want naturally colored cotton in the first place, particularly because 
colored cotton varieties yield as little as one-fifth the number of bales per 
acre as the high-yield -- and easily dyed -- Acala strain. 
</P>
<P>
Fox and her supporters have their theories. 
</P>
<P>
One is that naturally colored cotton is novel and catchy enough to appeal to 
upscale consumers who drink expensive bottled water and prefer imported cars 
over domestic sedans. 
</P>
<P>
Another is that it might appeal to narrow specialty markets, such as people 
allergic to the harsh dyes used to color white cotton or hand-spinners who can 
mix colored cottons to achieve marble-like effects not otherwise possible. 
</P>
<P>
A third is that some growers, ginners and mill owners envision the day when 
strict antipollution laws may severely restrict the use not only of pesticides 
and other farm chemicals, but also limit use of commercial dyes that have been 
blamed for fouling the environment when garment makers dump their wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton mills on three continents already have shown an interest in obtaining as 
much of Fox's colored cotton as possible so they can investigate its uses. 
</P>
<P>
Fox recently sold her 1989 crop, a modest 122 bales of 500 pounds each, through 
a Canadian broker to a mill in Japan. The company said it would buy as much as 
Fox could grow, but she is limited by the cotton board to the 160-acre test 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such shortcomings, Fox said she sold her cotton for enough money to 
compensate for its low yield. She declined to release specific figures, saying 
they are proprietary information that could help a competitor, but a reputable 
cotton broker familiar with the deal confirmed her claim. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that it is known how valuable this is, it invites competition," said Fox, 
her normal cheerfulness sinking into anxiety. "I still don't feel strong enough 
to compete (with veteran growers more familiar with the cotton market). I still 
have too many mistakes to make and lessons to learn."
