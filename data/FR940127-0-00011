SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 
Classification 
We are issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a "significant
regulatory action." Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this final rule: (1)
Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an
action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.
Intergovernmental Consultation 
The programs affected are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under Numbers 10.405_Farm Labor Housing
Loans and Grants, 10.415_Rural Rental Housing Loans, and 10.427_Rural Rental Assistance Payments, and are subject
to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
(7 CFR part 3105, subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983; 49 FR 2267, May 31, 1984; 59 FR 14088, April 10, 1985) 
Environmental Impact Statement 
This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, "Environmental Program." It is the
determination of FmHA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190,
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 
Civil Justice Reform 
This regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided in
sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with state law are controlling.
All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B must be exhausted prior to filing suit. 
Discussion 
The Agency is improving FmHA oversight of MFH reserve accounts by requiring them to be subject to countersignature
in a supervised account. Reserve accounts were previously required to be funded and used in accordance with Agency
regulations, which already required the prior consent of the Agency prior to withdrawing reserve funds. However,
internal Agency reviews and audits conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), highlighted various violations
of Agency regulations and prompted the need for this final rulemaking action. 
Among the most common concerns uncovered to date include the withdrawal of reserve funds without Agency consent,
funds being pledged as security for other loans without Agency knowledge, withdrawal of interest earned on reserve
funds for non-project purposes, lenders withdrawing funds for application on other defaulted loans, reserve funds
withdrawn at a lending institution for application on other debts, and reserve accounts held at a lending institution
for a short period of time before transferring to another institution. 
The Agency expects to curtail reserve fund abuses by shifting emphasis to compliance through procedures aimed at
preventing abuses (e.g., requiring the countersignature of Agency officials for withdrawal of reserve funds which
are to be placed in a supervised account). The Agency's earlier procedures relied on oversight through monitoring
routines, with the threat of potential punitive measures being imposed should violations be discovered. 
The Agency solicited comments concerning the impact of the proposed rules on those holding reserve funds in money
market accounts, bonds, or financial holdings other than in checking or savings accounts in federally insured institutions.
The prior rulemaking action also mentioned that the Agency is aware that the proposed rule may result in some borrowers
having to pay financial fees or penalties, which will erode reserve funds, and is concerned that such adverse impacts
be minimized to the extent practical. The Agency also solicited other alternative approaches to curtail reserve
account abuses. The Agency desires to ensure that the rules to reduce reserve account abuses are met in a practical
manner without inadvertently imposing severe financial hardship on existing borrowers.
