THE Italian government is expected to set up a special commission in the
next few days to try to resolve its acrimonious dispute with the European
Commission over reducing overcapacity in the European steel industry.
A meeting of EU industry ministers broke up in disarray on Thursday after
Italy rejected demands by Brussels for a 2m cut in annual production
capacity at Ilva, the Italian state steel group.
The Rome government has been strongly resisting the scale of the Ilva cuts,
arguing that they would compromise the viability of the Taranto steel works
in southern Italy, the largest in Europe, and create a serious social
problem with rising unemployment.
Italy is now expected to draw up a new plan covering both the public and
private sector and Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, is expected to
establish a commission with a brief to find a solution acceptable to the EU.
Italy, it seems, is willing to play for high stakes. But it does not wish to
be seen pitted against all its partners, nor be accused of sabotaging
integration on the issue of steel which was central to the early stages of
forming an common market.
In the view of the unions, who are seeking an early meeting with the
government, the best solution would be to spread the production cuts into
the private sector. They argue that Taranto is a very modern plant with
another 30 years of productive life. Better to eliminate capacity among the
older private plants, in particular Falck's operation at Sesto San Giovanni
on the outskirts of Milan.
Taranto has an unemployment rate exceeding 25 per cent, and rationalisation
of Ilva puts a quarter of the 13,000 steel jobs there at risk. Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, last week took the unprecedented
step of writing a personal letter to Mr Jacques Delors, Commission
president, warning of 'explosive social consequences' if Taranto were
compromised.
The government has its hands full trying to ensure the 1994 budget passes
smoothly through parliament and is anxious to avoid social unrest as the
country moves towards an early general election.
The loss-making Ilva group, controlled by Iri, the state holding, is being
split in two covering flat products (essentially Taranto) and special
steels.
The main privatisation issue is who will take over Taranto. Both France's
Usinor and Nippon Steel are possibilities.
