Sviatoslav Richter returned to the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday afternoon.
A Richter piano recital is always a special experience, with the rarity of
its provenance tinged and heightened by the threat of peril (will he turn up
at all? will he cancel at the very last moment?).
On this occasion it was a breathtaking experience: the greatest living
pianist encountered at the peak of his powers, delivering Beethoven and
Schubert with awesome concentration of fire and ice, imaginative daring and
breadth of vision.
Jets of critical superlatives can afford wearisome reading. This time,
however, this particular reviewer was left no alternative to spraying out
whole streams of them: artistic completeness of the kind demonstrated by
Richter's second-half accounts of the Beethoven 'Pathetic' Sonata and the
Schubert 'Wanderer' Fantasia has the power to make one feel one has never
really heard either the works or the instrument itself before.
Two summers ago, when he came to Britain for concerts in London and
Aldeburgh, the weight of Richter's septuagenarian years and Slav melancholy
seemed to press a little harder on the playing than one had imagined they
ever could. On Sunday, the cares of age were cast aside. After a first half
of Bach - austere yet full of questing turns of phrase and touch, that was
like a testing of the waters - he plunged into the second with an urgency
all the more exhilarating for being directed entirely inward, to the music's
very centre.
The Beethoven was all urgency, every rhythmic pattern alert with immediate
forcefulness and long-term significance, the slow movement a taut span of
bated energy. The timbre and weight of the Yamaha grand, in some respects
not unlike that of a 'period' piano (but without the limitations of volume
and inequalities of registration), was made to seem the sound and substance
of Beethovenian argument.
There was no gap, no shortfall between idea and execution; nor - a handful
of forgivable, indeed hardly noticeable finger slips apart - was there in
the Schubert, one of the mightiest adventures of Romantic keyboard invention
here unfolded in all its majesty. After two Grieg encores, each one a
time-stopping marvel of fine-grained pianism, the concert was over, and one
was left wrung out, uplifted, cherishing its memory.
