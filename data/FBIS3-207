<F> [Speech by King Mswati III at the opening of the Sixth </F>
Parliament in Lobamba on 18 February--live] 
  [Text] Your majesty the Ndlovukazi, your royal highnesses, 
right honorable prime minister, chiefs, excellencies, members of 
the diplomatic corps, honorable ministers, Mr. President and 
honorable members of the House of Senate, Mr. Speaker, and 
honorable members of the House of Assembly. Distinguished 
guests, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by welcoming you all 
to the state opening of the first session of the Sixth 
Parliament of the Kingdom of Swaziland. 
  My first duty today, on behalf of the whole Swazi nation, is 
to commend the work of the previous government. In often 
difficult circumstances, and over a period of great change in 
the Kingdom, the prime minister and his cabinet team, along with 
the members of both houses of Parliament, worked hard for the 
development of the Kingdom. The nation owes a vote of 
appreciation to all who served us over this period. 
  Two years ago, the nation was in the process of deciding the 
direction to be taken -- of political reform. I made it clear 
then, in this chamber, that the future of Swaziland depended on 
the full, active, and peaceful participation of all Swazis in 
that process to achieve a result which would truly reflect the 
wishes of the majority of the country. The elections were 
clearly a success. They were accepted as freely and fairly 
conducted by the international community, and more importantly 
they were what we, the Swazi people, wanted. 
  Beyond the fact of a new electoral system, the reforms have 
been important to Swaziland as a means by which the whole Swazi 
family has been involved in a debate of national interest and 
significance. I should like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate the nation for its wholehearted participation and 
support of the process, and for the peaceful manner in which the 
exercise was conducted. Of course, the very nature of reform 
implies an ongoing process, and the recommendations given by the 
nation include many issues which still require attention. This 
we will address in the same manner -- carefully and peacefully 
and with the full knowledge and approval of the Kingdom. 
  I should also like to highlight the achievement of those of 
you sitting here who are very much the end result of the first 
reform initiative. You members of the House of Assembly, who 
have been chosen by your fellow Swazis to be their 
representatives in the country's most important legislative 
chamber, you take your seats here at a vital time in the 
Kingdom's history, and you and all members of both houses hold 
in your hands the hopes of those you represent, to ensure that 
the direction of our development aim is correct, and that the 
effects of development strategies implemented by government 
reach those who most need them, for the time has now come for 
the nation to direct its attention to the issue of greatest 
importance for our future stability and prosperity -- how best 
to tackle the economic problems facing the country today, and 
what steps we must take to sustain the progress toward achieving 
our national development objectives. 
  Before considering this economic challenge at a national 
level, we should understand the importance to Swaziland's 
development of events occurring around the world. These days of 
increasing economic inter-dependence between nations, the 
effects of situations in one part of the world, or the decisions 
of other countries and organizations, can have implications for 
the rest of us. One example of this, and one that perhaps has 
the greatest significance for the world's economic future, is 
the signing last December of the General Agreement of Tariffs 
and Trade. This was the result of many years of negotiations 
between all the major trading blocks aimed at breaking down 
trade barriers between countries, and it is an important step 
towards creating a world of free trade. 
  While Swaziland, along with other developing countries, can 
welcome the outcome of the agreement in terms of expanding 
markets for our exports, there are several short term 
disadvantages and implications for our economies to be taken 
into account. Two examples of these are, first, the issue of 
our unique access to various markets for our sugar, beef, and 
other products. Under the terms of GATT, this trading advantage 
will certainly fall away in time, reducing the revenue from 
those export markets. And second, linked to the first, is the 
fact that the agreement will mean all our exports will 
potentially be in direct competition with every other country. 
Thus, the GATT signing represents both an advantage and a 
challenge to the Kingdom. The advantage is the opening up of 
whole new markets for our exports, and the challenge to Swazi 
industry of producing exports which stand up to competition from 
the rest of the world. These are areas for national discussion 
as we determine ways to lift our levels of quality and 
efficiency in production. 
  At government level, we have already begun to lobby the 
First 
World to consider the penalties to developing countries of the 
agreement. The price to them of our support for the signing is 
their understanding of the potential harm it will do to our 
economies. In the short term, we are looking for a continuation 
to our preferential access to markets, at least until we are in 
a position to compete with the developed world in the export 
market place. This will be a challenge for government and an 
issue for which we will be looking to our friends in the 
international community for help and advice. 
  Conflict situations around the world too have an impact on 
us, not simply for the adverse effect they have on the world 
economy, but also because they tend to divert attention away 
from the development needs of emerging countries like Swaziland. 
The situation in Bosnia, for example, while providing an 
illustration of the dangers of division within a country, 
continues to draw resources and concern away from the developing 
world in a justifiable effort to resolve the crisis there. 
  Swaziland continues to support the process of negotiation 
between the three rival factions, and we pray that the use of 
force is avoided. We encourage the moves by the United Nations 
and the European Union to assist in finding a settlement to the 
dispute, and an end to the suffering of so many. 
  Another focus for world attention outside Africa has been 
the developments toward a lasting settlement in the Middle East. 
The danger of that troubled area developing once more into a 
global situation with huge economic and social (?cause) can 
never be overlooked. And so we welcome any moves which reduce 
tension and bring the separate nations closer together. 
  Swaziland with its long association with the state of Israel 
gives particular credit to the decision by the Israeli people 
and government to take the road of negotiation and 
reconciliation. It is one that we have supported constantly for 
many years. Despite the delays and setbacks, we are encouraged 
by the efforts of both sides -- Palestinians and Israel -- to 
push forward with the agreement signed last September. Let us 
hope that this first step in the process to real peace in the 
region can continue, and we trust that other steps to include 
all the people of the Middle East will soon create an atmosphere 
in which countries there can develop peacefully without the 
constant threat of violence and disaster. 
  And here in Africa the tragedy of civil war and internal 
strife in so many countries continues to affect the economic 
development of the continent as a whole and serves as a lesson 
to us all on the importance of maintaining unity within nations. 
The UN operation in Somalia has been the most expensive in the 
organization's history. With the withdrawal of most of the UN 
force in two months' time, let us pray that the lives, 
resources, and effort which have been expanded over the past 
year will not be wasted by a return to the bloodshed of recent 
history. 
  In Sudan, the ongoing conflict between different ethnic 
groups has resulted not only in death and destruction, but has 
caused the enforced movement of many thousands of refugees who 
now tax the resources of countries which are obliged to act as 
their temporary hosts. The economic effect of refugees on a 
country is one that we here can well understand and sympathize 
with. 
  And perhaps most tragic of all is the continuation of the 
daily shedding of blood in Angola, a country whose people have 
known no peace for over 20 years and who are paying the 
appalling price of the use of force to resolve their 
differences. As fellow member of two organizations of economic 
cooperation, the resolution of the conflict in Angola has 
particular importance for us. We hope that the negotiations 
underway in Lusaka signal the start of lasting peace to that 
unfortunate country so that her huge natural and human resources 
can contribute effectively to the economic future of our 
subregion. 
  Clearly though the economic implications to Swaziland of the 
situations in our two neighbors, Mozambique and South Africa, 
deserve our closest attention. The process of peace in 
Mozambique appears to be on course, and we congratulate all who 
have contributed toward its success so far. The effect on our 
economy of a stable and prosperous Mozambique cannot be 
overemphasized, and we must be doing all we can now not just to 
support the process, but to understand how best we can prepare 
ourselves to take the fullest advantage of a return to peace in 
our neighbor. It is imperative that we keep the channels of 
communication at all levels between governments, NGO's 
[nongovernmental organizations], and the private sector as open 
and as active as possible. Our shared border holds many 
possibilities for mutual economic improvement including 
increased trade, joint tourism projects, and the greater use by 
us of Mozambique's access to the sea. The success of the 
refugee repatriation program is the first indication of the 
importance we must attach to increasing cooperation with 
Mozambique and government must accept this as a major priority. 
  The same is true of our other neighbor, South Africa. The 
change in policy and direction of a new nonracial government in 
South Africa is undoubtedly the single most important factor for 
Swaziland's economic future. We would do well to fully 
understand the implications to us of change in a neighbor on 
whom we rely so heavily. The initiative lies with us to open 
the lines of communication with those with whom we will be 
dealing in future. With new figures in power in South Africa, it 
will be up to us to inform and educate about the needs of the 
Kingdom and to discuss with them the possibilities for increased 
economic cooperation. Of particular relevance are our shared 
natural resources, our various financial links and our numerous 
trade agreements. We must not ignore the significance to 
Swaziland of change in South Africa, and government must take 
the lead in establishing links as early as possible. 
  It follows that it is in Swaziland's best interest for South 
Africa to enjoy as peaceful a transition as possible to a stable 
and prosperous future. We, therefore, look with concern at the 
potential for disruption to the process toward elections in 
April of the non-involvement of large sections of South African 
society. We have constantly urged all parties in South Africa 
to grasp this opportunity to be a part of their country's 
future, and we continue to do so. Instability across our border 
has the gravest implications for us and we must do all we can to 
encourage a smooth transition. 
  One important aspect of a new South Africa, and one that has 
been in focus recently, is the future of those Swazis who 
through the unjust laws of Swazi territory over the years find 
themselves unwillingly members of a country which is not their 
own. The world should be left in no doubt that we are doing all 
in our power through peaceful negotiation to restore to the 
Kingdom the land and the people we have lost through a process 
of historical injustice. The recent establishment of a border 
adjustment committee signals our intention to proceed with this 
issue at the highest levels. The nation will also be aware that 
I raised the subject on a number of occasions last year, 
including at the United Nations. In the event that we do not 
achieve our aims before a change in government in South Africa, 
we are of course prepared to talk to those who will have been 
given the mandate to act as a result of the elections in April. 
History and the facts are on our side, and I'm confident that 
justice will be done. 
  And so we come to the issue of the Kingdom's economy at 
national level. Clearly the world recession, recent drought, 
and the number of international factors have combined to ensure 
very difficult economic times ahead for Swaziland. Our 
challenge as a nation is to identify the areas of problem, and 
then to formulate strategies which will ensure the economic 
stability and prosperity of the Swazi people for many 
generations to come. 
  I mentioned last year that following on from the successes 
of 
the consultation of the nation on our political future, the same 
process would be used to decide the Kingdom's economic choices. 
I intend summoning the nation in the very near future to 
propose a four-stage process aimed first at educating us all to 
the economic realities of the Kingdom. Then gathering opinion 
on our national development priorities, seeking views on how 
best to frame our strategy, and finally deciding on how we 
implement them. The first two steps require the active 
involvement of all Swazis. 
  The first stage, one of education, is vitally important as 
it 
is central to the process that we will all understand the 
limitations and realities of composing a national development 
plan within an underdeveloped country such as ours. We must 
acknowledge that there are no easy overnight solutions to our 
economic difficulties, and that the most important ingredients 
for future success will be hard work, sacrifice, and dedication. 
  The second stage will also involve the support of all 
Swazis, 
young and old. This is when we will confirm the nation's 
priority objectives, the direction to be given to government for 
the Kingdom's development. Key objectives from the past which 
still hold good today include economic growth, sustainable 
development, self-reliance, equity and participation, and social 
justice and stability. We will need to confirm these, and if 
necessary, amend or add to them. I should like to highlight 
some of the more important aspects of each objective to give 
focus for discussion. 
  The key to our future is clearly to achieve growth in our 
economy. The creation of jobs and the increase in gross 
domestic product must be central to any development strategy. 
How to achieve this will be a major point for debate in the 
process of national consultation ahead. One aspect for 
discussion with regard to job creation is the problem of how to 
create the right environment for investment both by Swazis and 
by international investors. 
  For Swazis the provision of capital and knowledge, with 
which 
to start up businesses, is perhaps the most vital. For foreign 
investment the provision of a business environment which is 
attractive in terms of incentives, infrastructure, skilled work 
force, and good industrial relations is crucial to success. 
These issues are being addressed within government, but the 
nation will want to contribute to the debate with ideas and not 
by action on how to improve this vital area. 
  Hand in hand with economic growth is the need to ensure that 
our development is sustainable, that we can manage to control 
and improve our economy to ensure constant progress over the 
years ahead to get us through times of global recession. 
  While acknowledging the importance of close economic 
cooperation with other countries in the region, it is 
nonetheless that we do everything possible to stand on our own 
in terms of producing the basic everyday requirements such as 
foodstuffs and essential manufactured goods. We must grasp the 
message that to rely on imports is to be at the mercy of changes 
in the world crisis and to miss out on business opportunities. 
Emphasis must surely be placed on self-reliance. 
  Since the days when we first considered ourselves to be a 
distinct separate nation, a fundamental theme in protecting the 
unity and independence of the Swazi people has been the quality 
of all members of the Swazi family and the active participation 
of all in the decisions affecting the Kingdom. This principle 
was central to the process of political reform over the last two 
years and guides us in the economic debate ahead. 
  And finally, an element of our national objectives which has 
drawn the nation together and one that has ensured our 
independence, is the principle of social justice resulting in 
peace and stability for the Kingdom for so many generations. 
When we survey the state of perhaps the majority of countries 
on our continent, we would do well to reflect on the importance 
of these final two principles, and to realize how sensible we 
have been in the past to insist on the maintenance of peace and 
stability through a policy of social justice at all costs. 
  Of course the stability of our country depends on many 
factors. One is the physical security of the Kingdom and the 
efficiency of those entrusted with maintaining our system of 
justice. In these days of increasing crime, there has been a 
marked decrease in confidence in our ability as a nation to 
enforce the law. The police and the courts in particular are 
finding their resources and capabilities stretched to the limit 
and new answers to this crisis need to be found. 
  One encouraging move is the recent undertaking by the police 
force to establish close working groups with the civilian 
community, and this is clearly an initiative which deserves all 
our support. Crime prevention is the social responsibility of us 
all, and not an issue to be shrugged off as a problem for the 
police alone. And for the courts, plans are already in hand to 
expand existing facilities and courts so that the backlog in 
cases can be based [as heard] and the administration of justice 
to be made more efficient. 
  Equally important though is the relationship between the 
police and the courts. There must be a mutual understanding and 
sympathy between these two critical elements of our justice 
system. The two must work in harmony and with closer 
cooperation toward achieving an overall raising of confidence in 
the processes of the law. We will be calling for views on how 
to improve in this vital area in the months ahead. 
  These then are some of the more important aspects of our 
national objectives, which the nation will be asked to consider 
during the process of consultation, and I would appeal to all in 
the Kingdom to give serious thought to the various questions 
raised. 
  Closely linked to our national development objectives is the 
confirmation of government priorities on spending. This is an 
issue that will occupy members of both houses following 
presentation of the budget by the minister for finance. Since 
independence, our three highest priorities for government 
spending have been health, education, and agriculture. These 
are recognized as being fundamental to the objectives of any 
developing country. But the nation will be asked to confirm 
whether in each case the specific targets for spending in each 
area is correct, and indeed whether other areas deserve more 
attention. 
  The provision of adequate health care to all members of the 
Swazi nation continues to demand our concern. New challenges in 
this field confront as we strive to increase health facilities. 
To make existing ones more efficient [word indistinct] of most 
agents to educate our people about the importance of health care 
and the prevention of diseases. 
  We have all been shocked to learn of the extent of the 
spread 
in the Kingdom of the killer disease, AIDS. Swaziland, along 
with many other countries, stands to lose whole generations to 
this menace. Unless we act with haste to contain the danger, the 
real enemy to finding a solution to this potential devastating 
problem, ignorance -- ignorance of what this disease is, 
ignorance of what we can do to prevent it, and ignorance of the 
effect on our future if we fail to contain it. 
  This is a challenge for us all to confront. We all have a 
role to play in educating others to the dangers. There must be 
a wholesale change in attitude to our social behavior. The only 
alternative is to witness a tragedy occur which will undermine 
all our development efforts and result in a future of misery for 
our children. We require a national policy on this issue, and 
we look to you seated here to give the nation its direction. 
  A central principle since independence has been our belief 
that a nation's future is dependent on the products of its 
schools. Access to education is right for all Swazis, and this 
remains a guiding objective for government today. There has 
been a long debate on the issue of what some call free 
education. This is an issue the nation shall be addressing in 
our forthcoming debate on the national strategies. It must be 
acknowledged though before discussion begins that there is no 
such thing as free education. In the end the nation will pay, 
whether perhaps through higher taxes or a change in government 
spending. There is clearly no magic source of funds to pay for 
free education. Swaziland must pay for Swazis to be educated. 
Nor is this something that can be changed in the short term. 
Whatever the outcome of national debate on this issue, there 
will be no overnight miracle to cancel the bill to Swazis for 
our education. 
  Perhaps of more immediate concern and an issue that can be 
addressed in the short term is that of the direction of our 
education. The question is: Are we preparing Swazis with the 
right training, knowledge, and skills to enter the market place 
as workers? This is something for the nation to consider in the 
months ahead and for government now to reflect on. 
  The third pillar of our current priorities is the 
development 
of our agricultural policies and the support given by government 
to our farmers. Agriculture remains the stable employment for 
the majority of Swazis and the foundation of our economy. It 
deserves its place at the top of the nation's priorities. 
However, the development and direction of our agricultural 
policies and the degree and extent on government support to our 
farmers is another subject for debate. We look for the 
individual input of ideas from the farming community toward the 
development of a national agricultural strategy. Our economic 
future depends to a large degree on the performance of the 
agricultural sector, and this will be central to our national 
development plan. 
  An aspect of agriculture which has been ignored too much and 
which requires the urgent attention of the members of both 
houses here is the continuing decline in the state of our 
environment and the abuse of our natural resources. It is a 
poor worker who does not look after the tools of his trade. For 
a country whose main employment is centered on the fruits of the 
soil, we must recognize that our most important asset is the 
land we have inherited from our forefathers. We must do all we 
can to protect our natural resources for without them we are 
nothing. 
  To protect does not mean to avoid using. Indeed in some 
respects we under use our natural resources. Certainly as an 
example, recent experience has taught us that we cannot expect 
by right to receive sufficient rainfall every year to sustain 
us, and that we must prepare ourselves in future to make more 
use of the precious water resources in the Kingdom. This 
includes more emphasis on the construction of dams and the 
identifying of other sources of water for our irrigation needs. 
But equally we ignore at pour peril the dangers of overuse of 
other natural resources. We must conserve our priceless assets 
so that they will provide for future generations as they have 
for the past. Our soil, our trees, our rivers, our livestock, 
and our wildlife. These are part of the rich fabric of 
Swaziland and must be preserved at all cost. They are the tools 
of our most important trade. We must look after them. 
  Earlier when discussing the impact on our economy of global 
free trade, I referred to the requirement for us to become more 
competitive as producers and suggested that efficiency was the 
key. This requirement for efficiency extends beyond the private 
sector and could perhaps become the watchword for all national 
business. Leading the way in this regard should be government 
and those organizations supported by government, the parastatals. 
  With a new start for government, this is the ideal time to 
introduce the notion of efficient practice in all public sector 
dealings. Improved efficiency equals increased productivity 
and, in the case of parastatals, this is something the nation 
expects to see. Too much of government's precious resources are 
spent on supporting the inefficiency of companies who should be 
self-sufficient and independent of public subventions. 
  Let us see the introduction of controlled measures on the 
performance of government and the parastatals and let improved 
efficiency in the public sector be an example to private 
business. 
  Before I include, I should like to address a few remarks to 
our friend in the international community. First, allow me on 
behalf of Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the government, and the 
whole Swazi nation to express my deep gratitude to you all for 
your continuing support and share the experience toward the 
development of the nation. That support has been generous and 
well directed in the past, and it is my hope that you will be 
able to continue to assist us as we decide on the way ahead. My 
theme today has been to focus the attention of the members of 
both houses of the nation's parliament and of the Kingdom's as a 
whole on to the economic challenge for Swaziland in the years to 
come. 
  During the process of consultation with all Swazis which 
will 
begin very shortly, we will be approaching the international 
community for advice based on experience gained in your own 
countries and elsewhere. This is an opportunity for your 
countries to be part of this important stage in our development 
and we will result in a detailed analysis of the targets for 
future development assistance. We urge to help us find the 
right way forward. [preceding two sentences as heard] 
  I have spoken at length about the challenge facing the 
nation 
in the years ahead. These are exciting times and you members of 
Parliament, Assembly and Senate are at the very center of the 
decision-making process. We ask for God's guidance in your 
deliberations in these chambers, and we urge you to reflect on 
the huge responsibility you share for the future of our Kingdom. 
You have our confidence and trust. We ask that you perform 
your duties to the nation with honor, loyalty, and dignity. 
  Thank you. God bless these proceedings.
