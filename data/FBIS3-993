  [Text] The Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania goes 
into this election fully confident that the oppressed masses 
will see through the fraud of the Kempton Park agreements and 
remember that the PAC opposed the deals. But even more, said 
president Clarence Mlamli Makwetu, the PAC hoped that Africans 
would vote for it because of the policies it espouses. 
  Policies such as a "caring economy", land repossession, its 
stand on violence, housing provision, health and on 
privatisation. Plagued by internal dissent over its 
participation in the negotiations, Makwetu says the decision was 
right and the PAC has many gains to show for its participation. 
  The chairing of the deliberations by judges had "given the 
regime an advantage as the judges are not neutral but State 
appointees. We said they should go, and they went", he said. 
To accusations that the PAC was "an also ran", a party that 
went into the talks but fails to get any of its points across, 
he said: 
  "We opposed the division of the country into regions. We 
were against the entire package. We want the return of the land 
and opposed property rights given to settlers. We did what we 
did but they were refused. But we got vote for the African 
people. We fought for it and we got it and that is important," 
Makweti said. 
  While the interim constitution provides for semi autonomous 
regions that are getting more powers through trilateral talks 
with the rightwing, the ANC [African National Congress] and the 
Government, the PAC wanted a centralised country and was asking 
for a mandate to change the interim constitution and bring a 
more people-oriented system. 
  "We rate our chances as very good. Opinion polls are not a 
factor, they do not worry us when they say we have very little 
support because they are never accurate. In Britain they said 
the Labour Party would win the last election and it did not 
happen. In Zimbabwe they said the same thing about ZANU 
[Zimbabwe African National Union] and Mugabe. In Lesotho 
recently, the BNP [Basotho National Party] was given a big lead, 
only for the BCP [Basotho Congress Party] to win all seats. We 
rely on the grassroots and our chances are good. 
  "We do not have money. We are not a rich organisation and we 
shall cut our suit according to our cloth. We are not going to 
rely as much on the media advertisements as other rich parties 
but we will do the canvassing ourselves. And it is in these 
campaigns that we see the support. When the PAC was formed in 
1960, we had only six branches on the Cape Peninsula, and a few 
in Soweto, Natal and Pretoria. But today for example, out of 
the 28 districts in Transkei, we have over 40 branches. We have 
branches all over the Orange Free State, Transvaal and the Cape. 
Our strength is there," he said. 
  Makwetu could not explain in detail what the caring economy 
promised by the PAC was. The PAC was opposed to capitalism and 
favoured socialism as a broad concept. "We want an economy that 
takes care of its people. Socialism itself as a word is 
meaningless and we believe that socialisation of economy, 
through the participation of workers in the process of ownership 
of industry will ensure that workers' interests are protected. 
Workers should be involved in decision making and also carry 
some of the responsibility that goes with that. Those who argue 
that socialism would fail, and that investors would flee should 
look at what is happening in China, where the entire Western 
world is flocking now," Makwetu said. 
  The PAC rejects the cut-off point of 1913 for land claims as 
contained in the interim constitution. "We say 1652 is the 
start of the land dispossession and should be the cut-off point. 
We will not pay for land that was stolen from us when we take 
it back. Compensation will only be considered for improvements 
made to the land," he added. 
  The repossession of the land will however not mean that each 
and every African will be given a piece of land. "Africans will 
have to make up their minds whether they want to be workers or 
farmers. And in the case of the latter, proof of an ability to 
farm will be needed before land is allocated for farming. We 
will also give each squatter a piece of a plot to live on. 
There is enough land in our country to do that and there is no 
need for the congestion that we see in every town." 
  The PAC does not have all the answers to the housing 
problem, 
he said. It foresaw a co-operation between the State -- which 
would provide land and infrastructure -- and the private sector. 
The PAC saw the ongoing violence as a state orchestrated 
phenomenon and rejected the idea that it was black on black. 
The PAC would curb ownership of guns and change laws so that no 
one could own 27 weapons as presently allowed by the law. 
  The violence had nothing to do with the armed struggle as 
the 
revolutionary forces were directing their energies against the 
regime, he said. His organisation cannot be specific about its 
health policy, except to say that one health care system will be 
in place. Whether the service will be free he could not yet 
say, he added. 
  The same applied to privatised national state concerns such 
as Iscor [South African Iron and Steel Corporation], Telkom and 
the Railways. Nationalisation usually benefited the new elite 
and not the people. The PAC however supported affirmative 
action but this would have to be done in a way that did not 
result in the lowering of standards. 
  Doors had to be opened and opportunities created for the 
development of entrepreneurs so that "Africans are not just a 
nation of workers and shop stewards." The playing field was 
presently unequal for political campaigning despite talks of 
this being done. "The international community and big business 
are supporting one party and I am afraid that I may not be able 
to convince my colleagues in the event of losing that the 
process had been free and fair," he said. 
  The PAC was however committed to the process and will honour 
and accept the outcome of the elections as it was convinced that 
despite all the hurdles, the African community would see through 
the process and vote for a party that will truly give them 
freedom and justice.
