NMFS has previously expressed concern that outmigrating juvenile winter-run chinook salmon may be adversely impacted
by the disposal of contaminated dredge sediments at disposal sites located in the San Francisco Bay area. The residence
time for outmigrating winter-run chinook salmon through the Bay is thought to range from 1 week to more than 2 months
depending on the water year type. Prey organisms utilized by juvenile winter-run chinook salmon may bioaccumulate
contaminants originating from in-bay disposal of contaminated dredge sediments, thereby exposing juveniles to
these contaminants as they forage and migrate through the Bay. 
Although NMFS continues to be concerned about the potential effects of in-bay disposal, the Corps has taken recent
action to ensure that in-bay disposal of contaminated materials does not occur. In June 1992, the Corps, EPA, the Regional
Water Quality Control Board, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission published proposed
interim testing guidelines for dredged sediments that would be disposed of at in-bay sites. On February 1, 1993, the
Corps formally adopted these guidelines in Public Notice 93-2. These interim testing guidelines are designed
to ensure that sufficient information is available to characterize sediments to be dredged for all projects so that
disposal does not result in chemical or biological degradation of the disposal site. These guidelines are intended
to apply to all open water disposal projects until a long-term plan for managing dredged sediments in the San Francisco
Bay area is developed and implemented. 
Although the interim testing guidelines adopted by the Corps represent an important short-term action aimed at preventing
the in-bay disposal of contaminated sediments, NMFS believes it is essential that a long-term strategy be developed
and implemented for San Francisco Bay area dredging and disposal activities. To meet this need, the Corps and several
other Federal, state and local agencies, including NMFS, are developing a Long-Term Management Strategy (LTMS)
for managing dredging and disposal activities. The LTMS is designed to provide appropriate dredged material disposal
alternatives for a 50-year planning horizon through the designation of ocean, in-bay, and upland disposal sites
and the identification of beneficial reuse options. Implementation of the LTMS management programs is anticipated
to begin in August 1994. 
Bank Stabilization
Bank stabilization projects in the Sacramento River are believed to adversely affect winter-run chinook salmon
rearing habitat. The Corp of Engineers has developed the Sacramento River Bank Protection Project as a long-range
program for construction of bank erosion control works. On October 28, 1991, NMFS issued a biological opinion to the
Corps that concluded Phase II of the project was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook
salmon. However, the incidental take statement issued with the opinion requires the Corps to select the least damaging
bank stabilization methods available and to provide NMFS with detailed mitigation plans for each bank protection
project in Phase II that would adversely affect winter-run chinook salmon habitat. Based on recent information developed
by the FWS concerning bank protection methods that minimize impacts and the importance of protecting shaded riverine
aquatic habitat, NMFS requested the Corps to reinitiate consultation on Phase II of the project in late 1992. The Corps
is currently developing additional environmental documentation for the remaining Phase II bank protection projects,
and NMFS anticipates that further consultation will be initiated when that documentation is completed.
