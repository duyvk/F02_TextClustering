  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  ANC To Escalate Mass Action in kwaZulu/Natal--Johannesburg 
THE CITIZEN in English on 28 March in its page-6 editorial notes 
that according to pollsters "there is no doubt that the ANC 
[African National Congress] will win hands down -- and might 
even get a two-thirds majority. Sadly, the ANC has become 
arrogant and intolerant." ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa 
has announced that the ANC would "escalate its rolling mass 
action" in kwaZulu/Natal "until Chief Buthelezi guarantees free 
political activity in the region. The danger that the low-key 
civil war there could flare into a full-scale conflict does not 
worry the ANC -- it is not going to give up its plan to topple 
Chief Buthelezi and it will proceed whatever the consequences." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  State May Have To Consider State of Emergency -- Referring 
to 
the violence that erupted in the wake of the Zulu rally in 
Johannesburg on 28 March, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 29 
March in a page-14 editorial says: "Any parties, or leaders 
playing a political role -- as Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is 
playing in this period -- have to ask themselves two questions 
among others. First, will our planned action have the 
effect of being provocative, and placing lives at risk? It 
is no defence to say this was not the intention. Second, have 
we ensured that none of our supporters is armed? Again, it is 
not good enough to say one didn't know. If political leaders -- 
from whatever party -- are not prepared to honour these basic 
responsibilities, then they invite inevitable illiberal censure: 
the temporary prohibition of some or all high-risk 
demonstrations." "A reversion to state of emergency politics 
would inevitably open the door to political abuse, and it would 
tragically mar the birth of the new South Africa. But if 
politicians are so cynical as to actively explore the Bosnia 
option, then it is a step that might have to be considered." 
  Only SADF Can Impose Free Political Activity in Natal -- A 
second editorial on the same page believes that if all else 
fails "one thing would stand between South Africa and a descent 
into utter chaos -- the presence of an effective and apolitical 
Defence Force." The South African Defense Force (SADF) has been 
called on recently to restore order in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, 
and Lebowa. "The SADF could yet face its stiffest challenge in 
kwaZulu. As matters there deteriorate, pressure is building up 
for a deployment of troops. Both ANC secretary-general Cyril 
Ramaphosa and the organisation's kwaZulu/Natal premiership 
candidate, Jacob Zuma, have called on the TEC [Transitional 
Executive Council] to send troops into the region. It is no 
longer a far-fetched prospect, and nor is it one to relish. But 
if free political activity has to be imposed, only the SADF can 
do it." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Attempts To Overthrow Kwazulu To Have `Horrendous Costs' -- 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 March in a page-16 
editorial also refers to the rally "called by traditional Zulu 
leaders in support of their king." 
  "The Johannesburg chaos, it should be noted, was not 
exceptional compared with the violence that has afflicted black 
residential communities on the East and West Rand, and in many 
parts of Natal, with the loss of thousands of lives. Strife of 
this magnitude rarely comes to the city centres, so for those 
not used to life in the townships it was particularly alarming." 
The events in Johannesburg "are evidence that ANC attempts to 
overthrow kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and 
Buthelezi's apparent resistance to a political settlement which 
may cost him his office, will have horrendous costs, possibly 
more than the economy can afford. The election must go ahead. 
But the chances of it being universally free and fair are 
declining. And it is almost too late to halt the spiral." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Editorial Blames IFP for Johannesburg Rally Violence -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 29 March in a page-8 
editorial places the blame for the deaths linked to the protest 
march in Johannesburg "squarely on the leadership of the Inkatha 
Freedom Party [IFP]. Nobody is fooled by people changing names 
at the drop of a hat -- one minute they are IFP leaders and the 
next they are `Zulus' protesting rather strenuously that they 
are not speaking for the IFP." SOWETAN also believes the 
violence "could only have been premeditated. First, there has 
been war talk from the leadership of the IFP; then there was the 
turning of a blind eye on the weapons that were displayed during 
the march; and finally there was the glaring absence of marshals 
to control the huge crowds."
