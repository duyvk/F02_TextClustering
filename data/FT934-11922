A HIGH-LEVEL court ruling in Germany has confirmed the right of petrol
stations to sell a range of goods after normal shopping hours.
The ruling by the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin increases pressure
for a wider lifting of Germany's restrictive and rigidly enforced laws on
shop opening hours.
Petrol stations will now be allowed to sell 'goods for journeys', an
expression which is defined as including non-alcoholic drinks, sweets,
newspapers and 'other goods'.
The ruling seems certain to accelerate a revived political debate on the
whole issue of shop opening hours, which are normally until 18.30 every
evening, and 14.00 on a Saturday. There is late opening on Thursday
evenings, and on the first Saturday each month.
