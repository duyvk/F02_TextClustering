  [Text] We start this newscast with Benin where all 
government offices have been paralyzed since this morning -- the 
first day of a renewable 72-hour general strike. The action was 
launched by 10 of the country's labor union federations which 
are demanding a minimum salary increase of 30 percent to 
compensate for the loss of purchasing power following the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. The strike is said to be 75 
percent effective, and is taking place in an atmosphere of 
absolute calm. From Cotonou, Ange-Hermann Gname reports. 
  [Begin Gname recording] Government offices, schools, customs 
offices, the main post office, and some parastatal offices have 
complied with the 72-hour strike order issued by the Federation 
of Beninese Workers' Unions, and have done so in absolute calm. 
This morning, the few workers who turned up at their workplaces 
either went to provide minimum services or to see for themselves 
the absence of their colleagues from work. Since this morning, 
the national radio has only been broadcasting a very light 
program which has not exceeded two and a half hours of air time. 
Policemen have been guarding the deserted government offices 
against any possible acts of vandalism. The Agency for Air 
Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar has also joined the 
strike and there was no movement of planes this morning at the 
Cotonou International Aiport. Only a minimum service permitted 
the flight by a Nigerian military aircraft of President 
Nicephore Soglo -- chairman of the Economic Community of West 
African States -- to Liberia, where he is supposed to chair the 
inauguration ceremony of the new democratic institutions in 
Monrovia today. 
  As we can see, the strike order has been well followed by 
the 
workers at a time when the Cotonou government is having a lot of 
difficulty in easing the social tension which has worsened since 
the devaluation of the CFA franc. [end recording]
