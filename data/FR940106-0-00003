SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 
The regulations in 7 CFR part 322 (referred to below as the regulations) 
govern the importation into the United States of honeybees and honeybee semen. 
These regulations were established pursuant to the Honeybee Act (7 U.S.C. 281 
et seq.) The Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the 
Sect.United States of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees. In addition, 
the Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the United States 
of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. 
Section 322.1 of the regulations contains a footnote that includes the 
criteria set forth in the Honeybee Act for determining which countries may be 
listed in the regulations as countries from which honeybees or honeybee semen 
may be imported into the United States. In this rule, we are amending that 
footnote to reflect amendments to the Honeybee Act made by section 361(d)(2) 
of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. 
On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective January 1, 1994. To implement 
this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103-182). The statutory amendments 
included in the Act become effective coincident with NAFTA. 
Section 361(d)(2) of the Act amended subsections (a) and (b) of the 
Honeybee Act by providing the following: (1) That honeybees may be imported 
from Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms as the Secretary of Agriculture 
determines appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada 
or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely to remain, 
free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or 
subspecies of honeybees; and (2) that honeybee semen may be imported from 
Canada or Mexico, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the region 
of Canada or Mexico from which the imports originate is, and is likely to 
remain, free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. (See Pub. L. 
103-182; 107 Stat. 2057). 
This rule is being published to conform a footnote in the regulations with 
the Act, as amended.
