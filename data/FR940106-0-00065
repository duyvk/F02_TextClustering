It is not anticipated that lowering the level of the trip limit (or the harvest guideline) will reduce the fishing mortality
of POP. The level of catch will vary with effort in the Vancouver-Columbia area, and it is possible that the overfishing
level will be reached, but not substantially exceeded, in 1994. Under the same harvest guideline and trip limit (3,000
pounds (1,361 kg) or 20 percent of all groundfish per trip, whichever is less), the total landings were 1,378 mt in 1991,
1,023 mt in 1992, and are projected at 1,214 mt in 1993. 
Discards. 
Stock assessments and inseason catch monitoring are designed to account for all fishing mortality, including that
resulting from fish discarded at sea. Discards of rockfish and sablefish in the fishery for whiting processed at sea
are well-monitored and are accounted for inseason as they occur. In the other fisheries, discards caused by trip limits
are not monitored, so discard factors have been developed to reasonably account for this extra catch. These discard
factors are applied in several ways. 
In some cases (trawl sablefish, widow rockfish, bocaccio, Dover sole), the discard factor was used in the stock assessment
and in the setting of the ABC. Therefore the ABC and harvest guideline are defined in terms of landed catch. No additional
discard factor is applied to inseason catch projections. 
In other cases (yellowtail rockfish, POP, thornyheads), a discard factor was not anticipated in the stock assessment
leading to the setting of the ABC because the assessment was conducted before the trip limits became low enough to induce
discards. For POP and thornyheads, an estimate of discards caused by trip limits has been subtracted from the ABC so
that the harvest guideline represents only the landed catch. For yellowtail rockfish, a variety of gears with different
discard levels contribute to the catch, so the harvest guideline is set equal to ABC and landings are adjusted by a discard
factor during the season to estimate total removals. 
The level of trip limit discard is not monitored. A level previously measured for widow rockfish (16 percent) in a scientific
study is assumed to be appropriate for the commercial fisheries for widow rockfish, yellowtail rockfish and POP.
A lower level of 8 percent is used for the deepwater thornyhead fishery. 
Discarded bycatch in the Pacific whiting fishery always is counted towards the harvest guideline inseason because
this source of discard is measured accurately by observers and is variable from year to year. 
Foreign and domestic fisheries. 
For those species needing individual management that will not be fully utilized by domestic processors or harvesters,
and that can be caught without severely impacting species that are fully utilized by domestic processors or harvesters,
the harvest guidelines or quotas may be apportioned to domestic annual harvest (DAH, which includes domestic annual
processing (DAP) and joint venture processing (JVP)) and the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). In
1994, there are no surplus groundfish available for joint venture or foreign fishing operations. Consequently,
all the harvest guidelines in 1994 are designated entirely for DAP (which also equals DAH), and JVP and TALFF are set
at zero. 
In the unlikely event that a foreign or joint venture fishery should occur, the incidental catch levels would be the
same as announced at Table 2, footnote 1 of 58 FR 2990 (January 7, 1993). 
The Limited-Entry Program_Effective January 1, 1994 
Amendment 6 to the FMP establishes a limited-entry program which divides the groundfish fishery into two components,
the limited-entry fishery and the open-access fishery, each of which has its own allocations and management measures.
The limited-entry and open-access allocations are calculated according to a formula specified in the FMP and implementing
regulations, and are announced annually with the ABC and harvest guideline specifications. At its November 1993
meeting, the Council recommended the species and areas subject to open-access and limited-entry allocations in
1994, and the Regional Director calculated the amounts of the allocations which are presented in Table 1. Unless otherwise
specified, the limited-entry and open-access allocations are treated as harvest guidelines in 1994. 
Open-access allocations. 
The open-access fishery means the fishery composed of vessels using (i) exempt gear, or (ii) longline or pot (trap)
gear used pursuant to the harvest guidelines, quotas, and other management measures governing the open-access fishery.
Exempt gear means all types of fishing gear except groundfish trawl, longline, and pots. (Exempt gear includes trawls
used to harvest pink shrimp or spot or ridgeback prawns (shrimp trawls), and, south of Point Arena, California, California
halibut, or sea cucumbers.) Simply put, open-access gear is all types of fishing gear except longline, pot, or groundfish
trawl gear fished by a vessel that has a limited-entry permit affixed with a gear endorsement for that gear. 
The open-access allocation is derived by applying the open-access allocation percentage to the annual harvest guideline
or quota after subtracting any set asides for recreational fishing or treaty Indians under sections II.E. (b) and
(c) of the Appendix to part 663. For those species in which the open-access share would have been less than one percent,
no open-access allocation is specified for 1994 because significant open-access effort is not anticipated. At the
time the calculations were made, the status of some vessels (whether or not they would receive a limited-entry permit)
was not certain. The catch by these vessels was divided equally between the limited-entry and open-access allocations.
The highest "undecided" amount is 4.7 percent for the catch of species used to represent bocaccio during the window
period. Therefore the greatest potential error in any of the open-access or limited-entry allocations is less than
2.5 percent of the harvest guideline. This level of error would not result in a change in any of the trip limits for the
limited-entry or open-access fisheries.
