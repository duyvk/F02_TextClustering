The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Contemporary Documentary Series 
continues at UCLA Melnitz tonight at 8 with Andrzej Czarnecki's 22-minute "The 
Rat Catcher" (1986) and Frank Heiman's 55-minute "Paradise Camp" (1986). 
</P>
<P>
The first is a creepy stunner, a close-up, deadpan look at Poland's only 
industrial rat exterminator at work, an ordinary-looking, heavy-set middle-aged 
man who takes justifiable pride in his work, which involves getting his prey to 
trust him. No doubt this man is invaluable, but Czarnecki disturbingly 
confronts us with the repelling yet clearly seductive and gratifying aspect of 
his work as a mass killer.

Since "The Rat Catcher" so easily functions as parable, it's tasteless to have 
paired it with a film in which humans, not rats, are the victims. "Paradise 
Camp" is the usual mix of interviews with Holocaust survivors and archival 
materials, but there's a difference. The camp in question is Theresienstadt, a 
quaint walled city in Czechoslovakia, which, in cruelly deceiving propaganda -- 
including even a faked documentary -- the Nazis passed off to the Swiss Red 
Cross as a paradise for Jews and typical of all concentration camps; survivors 
attest to the fact that it too was a hell on Earth.

The New Beverly Cinema is presenting on Wednesday and Thursday (with the recent 
and exquisite "Sorceress") a rare revival of Robert Bresson's "The Trial of 
Joan of Arc," a terse, 65-minute, documentary-style courtroom drama in which 
the heroine's speeches come verbatim from historic transcripts and which 
derives its impact from Bresson's dry detachment. Florence Carrez is the 
resilient Joan, who may weep in private, but who answers her inquisitors with 
an almost monotonous matter-of-factness.
