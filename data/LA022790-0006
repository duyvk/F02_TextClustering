metallic implants to replace or support bone. His early research in the field 
helped lay the groundwork for the field known as biomechanics. A technique for 
managing bone and soft tissue infections was dubbed the "Jergey Tube" after 
Jergesen developed the method to both drain wounds and administer antibiotics. 
After 34 years of teaching at the UC San Francisco, Jergesen retired from 
teaching in 1980, when he was appointed to the emeritus faculty. In San
