I was brought up with a strict sense of duty. I had to profess certain 
ideological principles, to love the proletariats of all countries and to defend 
them from imperialist intrigues. It was explained to me all the time "who was 
who" and "who had the right to what." My schooling, my medical treatment, my 
home, my job -- the state indefatigably took care of all of them for me. Who my 
doctor was and where he or she could treat me were prescribed. There were no 
exceptions. I had no choice but to learn from the sanctioned textbooks in a 
strictly controlled institution. The hospital in which I was born reflected my 
parents' rank and place of residence -- a designated apartment. The price of 
the food I ate -- my eventual salary -- were set by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The word "freedom" itself was suspect. Its connotations -- its very definitions 
-- were always negative. 
</P>
<P>
My way of life and that of the vast majority of Soviet citizens is, in short, 
as different from yours as American football is from European soccer. For 
Americans to understand perestroika, they must realize how much we will have to 
overcome to become part of humanity, because our paths to that goal are so 
different. Thus, I feel the need to write -- so you will understand us better. 
</P>
<P>
I was weaned from the concept of freedom much as submarine crew members are 
trained not to breathe freely. Yet, over the past few years, the world has 
sensed how great is our genetic code for freedom. It's similar to the latent 
resiliency in a branch that has been bent to the ground under the weight of 
winter's snow: As soon as the snow melts, it springs back. 
</P>
<P>
The snow has not yet melted, and we are already springing back. We're learning 
how to speak our minds without fearing the person at the adjacent table or the 
possibility that an unknown listener may be on the telephone line. The 
prescribed patriotism that was our lifelong duty to honor is being replaced by 
responsibility for our life and our country. We have learned to call things by 
their proper names. 
</P>
<P>
An interesting plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party was 
concluded the second week of February. The party leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
called for an end to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. This was 
essentially a confirmation of what is already occurring in the country: The 
developing democratic processes have broken the party's monopoly. Many party 
members also came to understand that increasingly associated with their 
monopoly on power is responsibility for the state of our society. 
</P>
<P>
Changes are taking place very quickly. Events are piling up. The clock of 
history is running fast. Throughout, it's important not to lose contact with 
the political activism of the masses, which is growing swiftly. The masses are 
not organized in any real sense; that is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing to fly from the awakening popular volcano will be a clod of 
dirt. The conservative forces are sending little packs of chauvinists in black 
overcoats into the streets to threaten pogroms and intimidate people. But the 
lava is stirring and organizing itself. 
</P>
<P>
After a writers' meeting was broken up by fascist-style organizers last month, 
I invited several leaders of the semi-formal Moscow associations to the 
editorial offices of our magazine, Ogonyok. They urged that an 
anti-conservative demonstration be held to demonstrate mass support for 
Gorbachev and his democratic reforms. All understood that the Soviet system is 
incapable of offering anyone more liberal than Gorbachev. Leftist attempts to 
shake his position may lead not to a more liberal leader but to a Soviet 
Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
My visitors said that such a demonstration would attract 200,000 people. I 
thought they were boasting. I was wrong: More than 200,000 marched to the walls 
of the Kremlin on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing to speak to the swaying ocean of heads, I thought again of how the 
people are attracted to freedom, of how quickly they become fearless, of how 
hard it will be to stop them now that they are awakened. Moreover, the 
fearlessness of a people prepared to accept responsibility for the fate of 
their society and their country must be appreciated. What is wonderful about 
the present process is that it shows how desperate the people's determination 
is to stand up for integrity and freedom, and how doomed are the attempts to 
intimidate them again. 
</P>
<P>
These days, I try not to leave Moscow for long, because perestroika is 
imperiled. I am informed in ominous tones that our magazine will make a mistake 
and "be exposed." With Ogonyok's circulation reaching 14.5 million, we are 
constantly being reproached for having so large a readership. Our color 
supplements are taken away; the printing process is dragged out. Working 
conditions are much more difficult. Our pay is very little. Only the salaries 
of party bureaucrats and those who work for party publications are being 
raised. All this and more is being done to scare away our best employees or to 
silence our magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The people do not hide their desire to overcome inequity. Many of the roots of 
disintegrated movements, both in the Communist Party and in the country, are 
traceable to the desire to break away quickly from an inequitably organized 
whole to create a small but honestly conducted association of like minds or 
nationality. Not that long ago in the Ukrainian town of Chernigov, the local 
authorities were overthrown. The flash point was the baggage compartment of a 
car belonging to one of the officials that popped open in the town's central 
square. A volume of the classics of Marxism was not inside. Instead, delicacies 
long absent from the local grocery stores were found. 
</P>
<P>
People in my country are monstrously cut off from the fruits of their labor, 
yet another reason why they work poorly. The agricultural industry cannot feed 
the most expansive and resource-rich country in the world because the peasants 
do not understand who they are working for. Sometimes peasants who produce 
grain must travel to town to buy baked bread. Those who raise livestock have no 
idea where the sausage made from their meat is sold. The bureaucratic state has 
strikingly distanced itself from its own people. 
</P>
<P>
This is why the process of perestroika is so difficult and multilayered and why 
attempts to achieve new goals using former production methods are pointless. 
But it's unclear how to get away from the former leaders. It is like the 
Australian who bought a new boomerang but went out of his mind because he 
couldn't get rid of the old one. 
</P>
<P>
There are growing signs of bureaucratic opposition to perestroika. Be 
attentive. While getting caught up in the colorfulness of revolutionary 
flashiness, you sometimes lose sight of the main thing -- the difficult process 
of real change and the routine of renovation. The forces opposing perestroika 
and democratization are reaching the end of their self-imposed deadline. I feel 
their hatred with my skin, with my mind. I have known it my entire life, and I 
am tired of it. But I do not see any way out -- except for a daily struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Understand yet another peculiarity of our society: It has practically never 
known a multiparty system. The authority of the almighty chief, with his right 
to punish and pardon, has eaten into the genetic code of every one of us, and 
into our historical memory. It presses on us like an enormous lump of fear. We 
are becoming a part of humanity with difficulty, but we are doing it. I 
received a letter from a reader of Ogonyok in California. "What have you come 
to?" she wrote in reference to the magazine's struggle against social 
privileges. "What falls under the category of social privileges, to your mind? 
The right of a government minister to get a pound of frankfurters without 
waiting in line? The right to get a tooth filled in a clean clinic? The right 
for a three-member family to move into a three-room apartment? Just think of 
how that looks from the outside . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The rights of the people, and the struggle for these rights, is an unstoppable 
right in all the countries of the world. Every people has its own concerns, but 
all the same we are growing together in terms of our humanity and our concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Life is short and stormy. I just received a telephone call from Kharkov, the 
town in the Ukraine that elected me to Parliament. I was read the resolution of 
an anti-conservative meeting. An action committee is also meeting in Moscow to 
discuss the formation of a new political party. The postal carrier has just 
delivered yet another anonymous, threatening letter. Life, swirling all around, 
has never been so intense, so dangerous -- so full of hope. The cost of 
happiness is struggle and sometimes life itself, and now is the time for us to 
win our happiness. This is very hard.
