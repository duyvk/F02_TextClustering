<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:
 EPA is announcing in this notice that it is expanding the acreage cut-off for when an Experimental Use Permit (EUP)
is required under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) from 10 acres to 250 acres for a
class of biological pesticides. This class of pesticides covers arthropod pheromone products in solid matrix dispensers
used at rates at or below a total use rate of 150 grams active ingredient (AI)/acre/year. Tests conducted on these pheromone
formulations under the conditions specified in this notice would not require an EUP at acreages up to and including
250 acres. Tests conducted on acreages exceeding 250 acres would require an EUP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 
I. Introduction 
In keeping with the Administrator's commitment to reduce the use of higher risk pesticides and provide incentives
for the adoption of lower-risk pest management methods, EPA is announcing in this notice a new policy of allowing testing
of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers (e.g., twist ties, plastic tapes, and ropes) on no more than 250 acres to proceed
without an EUP. EPA recognizes that alternative pest control strategies, integrated pest management, and reduced
risk pesticides, such as pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, are fundamental elements of an overall program to
reduce risks to humans and the environment. 
Insect species utilize certain volatile compounds, semiochemicals, and pheromones, to communicate with each other
(e.g., to locate and attract mates or give alarm). For purposes of this notice, EPA defines a semiochemical as a chemical
that transmits messages between living organisms. A pheromone, which is a type of semiochemical, is defined as a compound
produced by an arthropod which, alone or in combination with other such compounds, modifies the behavior of other
individuals of the same species (40 CFR 152.25(b)(1)). Even very low amounts of these naturally occurring volatile
compounds can confuse normal insect behavior thus interrupting mating and preventing reproduction. These chemicals
may pose a relatively low risk alternative for managing insect pest populations. The use of semiochemicals, including
pheromones, to attract and trap insects has been a viable pest management technology for a considerable period of
time. In 1979, EPA first registered pheromones for use in traps for the purpose of mass trapping Japanese Beetles.
Since then, the Agency has registered approximately 30 semiochemical pesticides with approximately 20 active ingredients
being Lepidoptera pheromones. 
It was in the late 1970s that EPA recognized that biochemical pesticides, including pheromones, were inherently
different from most broad spectrum conventional pesticides and encouraged their development and registration,
considering them to be potentially lower risk alternatives to conventional synthetic products on the market. The
development of reduced safety data requirements currently in place for the registration of biochemical pesticides
is based on the Agency's classification of a biochemical pesticide by two criteria: (1) The compound's non-toxic
mode of action on the target pest, and (2) the natural occurrence of the compound. While not criteria for biochemical
classification, arthropod pheromone products also have a low use rate, usually below 20 grams per acre, and target
species specificity, therefore less expected environmental impact than other pesticides. 
The conditions under which an EUP, the first step in the regulation process, is required and the data which is required
for an EUP application are major areas of concern by researchers and producers of pheromone pesticide products. A
1987 survey of companies actively involved in the registration of pheromones and companies that have considered
and rejected pheromone development indicated that industry considered data requirements for pheromones to be excessive
given the relatively safe nature of these substances, their extremely low rate of application, and their short persistence.
Furthermore, it was noted that the applicant must incur the costs of developing most of the data to obtain an EUP, a stage
in the product's development often too early to tell whether the pheromone is viable as a pesticide product. Given
the limited earning potential of pheromone products, such testing costs tend to be prohibitively expensive; this
is in addition to the high initial production costs of the pheromones themselves. 
Over the years, industry has suggested several changes in EPA rules and procedures to aid the development and ease
the regulatory standards for pheromones and similar semiochemicals. The Agency is now at a point where it believes
there is a sufficient body of information in the public literature and has adequate data available on arthropod pheromones,
and is now taking steps toward this end. 
Today's notice announces a new agency policy of allowing pheromones in solid matrix dispensers to be tested on acreages
not exceeding 250 acres of land under the conditions specified in this notice without an EUP. This policy only applies
to arthropod pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, as defined in this notice, applied at rates not to exceed 150 grams
AI/acre/year. 
Conditional relief consisting of exemption from regulation under FIFRA has previously been granted by EPA for pheromone
traps in which the pheromones are the sole active ingredient(s) (See 40 CFR 152.25(b)). In addition, EPA, on its own
initiative, issued a proposed rule in the Federal Register of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538), which proposes to exempt
from the requirement of a tolerance under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) the residues of arthropod
pheromones resulting from the use of these substances in solid matrix dispensers with an annual application rate
limitation of 150 grams AI/acre/year for pest control in or on all raw agricultural commodities. The scope of pheromone
products exempted by this tolerance proposal would be the same as the scope of products subject to this notice. EPA
currently is considering whether to take additional actions to grant further regulatory relief for other types of
pheromone products. If EPA determines that any such regulatory relief is warranted, EPA would announce such a decision
in a future 
Federal Register
 notice.
II. Statutory and Regulatory Authority 
Section 5 of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. 136c and 40 CFR part 172 provide for issuance by the Agency of EUP's for the testing of new,
unregistered, pesticides or registered pesticides being tested for new uses, in which the purpose is only to determine
its value for pesticide purposes or to determine its toxicity or other properties. Such permits are generally issued
for large-scale testing of pesticides on more than 10 acres. Contained within the scope of the regulation, however,
is the presumption that small-scale testing, i.e., on not more than 10 acres of land, does not require an EUP provided
that the crops are destroyed or an appropriate tolerance is in place (40 CFR 172.3(a)). This presumption, however,
is caveated not to preclude experimental testing on larger areas in certain circumstances where the purpose of the
large acreage test is only to determine the substance's value for pesticidal purposes or to determine its toxicity
or other properties, and no benefit from pest control is expected (40 CFR 172.3(b)). EPA issued in the 
Federal Register
 of January 22, 1993 (58 FR 5878), a proposed amendment to 40 CFR part 172. The proposed amendment would, among other
things, modify Sect.172.3 to clarify that the determination of whether an EUP is required is based on risk considerations.
The amendment would provide that tests conducted on not more than 10 acres of land are presumed not to involve unreasonable
risks, and therefore, do not require an EUP. 
EPA believes that pheromone products in solid matrix dispensers must be tested at acreages larger than 10 acres and
as large as 250 acres to determine the products' value for pesticidal purposes. The 10 acre presumption in 40 CFR 172.3(a)
is appropriate for most substances, which can be tested to determine their value for pesticidal purposes at small
acreages below 10 acres. Due to the unique characteristics of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, however, these
products must be tested at much larger acreages. Most pheromone uses involve mating disruption. Unlike traditional
toxicants which usually focus on killing the immature insect (which often does the most damage), pheromones act upon
the adult. 
Insects use pheromones to locate potential mates. When pheromones are introduced over an area by man as a pest control
technique, the insects become confused by the seemingly ubiquitous presence of the guiding compound and therefore
cannot find a suitable mate. When successful, pheromone applications result in reduced mating, lower insemination
rates, and therefore lower population densities in the next generation. The evaluation of pheromones cannot be accomplished
on small acreages because the treated area must be of sufficient size to account for the natural flight range of the
target pests, such that already mated females flying into the test area do not skew the results of the study. This problem
does not occur for most traditional toxicant pesticides which usually target the immature stage as these earlier
life stages do not possess the capability of flight. 
An additional factor necessitating larger acreages is the volatile nature of most pheromone compounds. It is unfeasible
to adequately separate treatments with small plots. For these reasons pheromones are usually tested in plot sizes
ranging from 20 to 60 acres, depending upon the nature of the treated site and the pest in question. To provide scientifically
sound information, it is generally conceded that four to six replications are necessary to validate the findings.
Thus, the position that 250 acres should be sufficient to determine the value for pesticidal purposes of most pheromones.
Moreover, as discussed in the section entitled "Exposure and Effect," below, EPA believes that pheromones in solid
matrix dispensers tested on no more than 250 acres and at maximum application rates of 150 grams AI/acre/year will
not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. 
III. Exposure and Effect 
Since 1986, EPA has reviewed many arthropod-active pheromone products and has extensively reviewed pheromone toxicology
data from the public literature. Based on this information, discussed more fully below, EPA believes that field tests
conducted with pheromones in solid matrix dispensers and under the conditions outlined in this policy, will not cause
unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. This conclusion is based on a number of factors, including the generally
low toxicity and high volatility of pheromones, the low environmental and human exposure expected from pheromones
used in solid matrix dispensers, and the low application rates and limited acreage required by this policy. Although
the natural background level of pheromones in the atmosphere has never directly been determined, atmospheric levels
for some pheromones have been estimated for peak population levels based on the pheromone emission rates for individual
female arthropods. These estimated values range widely since they can be based on the amount of pheromone present
in extracted glands or the measured emission rate and depend on what is considered the adult population during a peak
pest infestation. To safeguard for the lack of data on natural background levels, EPA has determined to set an upper
limit on the total amount of active ingredient released per acre per year from solid matrix dispensers at 150 gm. The
upper limit rate is necessary to ensure that pheromones used in solid matrix dispensers do not result in increased
levels of pheromones beyond natural background levels. 
The current upper limit for the application of a biochemical active ingredient lacking significant toxic effects
that does not require the submission of residue data is 20 grams AI/acre (40 CFR 158.690(b)(2)(B)). To facilitate
testing of pheromones for pesticidal purposes, the Agency is setting a more realistic upper limit for the amount of
active ingredient released during a season before an EUP is required. The Agency has found that given the low expected
toxicity and high volatility of arthropod pheromones, an upper limit of 150 grams AI/acre/year is adequate for testing
a pheromone product's feasibility and efficacy while still protecting public health, nontarget organisms and the
environment from unreasonable risks from compound levels which may be above ambient natural productions. These
application rates encompass the majority of pheromone uses seen by the Agency to date. 
IV. Human Health 
The study results and submitted data available to date have indicated the following: acute oral toxicity - (LD
50
 > 5,000 mg/kg category IV (nontoxic)); acute dermal toxicity (LD
50
 > 2,000 mg/kg category IV, (nontoxic)), acute inhalation toxicity (LD
50
 generally > 5 mg/L- category III-IV, practically (nontoxic)); no evidence of mutagenicity (Ames Salmonella assay);
and minimal eye and skin irritation. 
EPA has reviewed the results of submitted mammalian toxicology studies for the pheromone products registered to
date and also pheromone toxicology data from the public literature. The majority of the compounds registered to date
(26 of 31) have been Lepidopteran (e.g. butterfly and moth) pheromones. These registered pheromones fall within
a well defined class of chemical structures: aliphatic compounds with straight chains from 9 to 18 carbons in length
and up to 3 double bonds, and ending in an acetate, alcohol, aldehyde functional group. Pheromones have been discovered
with other chemical structures including compounds with ketone, epoxide, lactone, terpenoid, pyrazine, pyran,
and aromatic structures. In 1983, when EPA promulgated the exemption for pheromones used in traps, the Agency did
not distinguish between the rather restricted class of chemicals produced by Lepidopteran species and pheromones
with different chemical structures produced by other arthropod species (e.g. beetles, flies, and mites) for use
in traps. Because the proposed interpretation that the use of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers at an annual rate
of up to 150 gm AI/acre represents the same human risk as the use of pheromones in traps, EPA does not believe there is
a reason to distinguish between chemical classes of pheromones for pheromones in solid matrix dispensers. 
While the toxicology data base for pheromones with structures outside the well defined aliphatic Lepidopteran pheromones,
such as aromatic compounds, is not as extensive, there is no indication of significant toxic effects to mammalian
species from those compounds registered to date. The literature indicates that some aromatic pheromone compounds
could be potentially toxic due to structural similarities to other aromatic compounds. The data available to date
on both Lepidopteran and other arthropod pheromones, including several aromatic pheromones, however, have indicated
no mammalian toxicity at the limit dose levels. 
The volatility of these compounds also predicts that little, if any, of the released compound will actually be associated
with the crop. Studies to measure the natural background levels of insect pheromones in the environment or in or on
fruit indicate little or no detectable residues. When pheromone residue analyses were done on fruit treated with
from 129 to 141 gm AI/acre, no residues could be found with a detection limit of 2 to 5 ppb (Refs. 1 and 2). The current regulations
provide that, in the absence of any significant toxic effects, residue analysis can be required when biochemical
pesticides are applied above 20 gm AI/acre (40 CFR 158.690(b)). The Agency recognizes that the 150 gm AI/acre/yr rate
is well above the 20 gm/acre limit triggering a food residue analysis. However, the negligible exposure for pheromones
in dispensers, the natural occurrence of these compounds, their rapid biodegradation, high volatility and low worker
exposure associated with solid matrix dispensers justify raising the limit for when an EUP is required for testing
these volatile biochemical pesticides. 
Moreover, the Agency believes that an upper limit of 150 gm AI/acre/year for pheromones labeled for use in dispensers
as described below does not present a significant risk of dietary exposure due to the unlikelihood of direct contact
with food and the low probability of deposition on food or feed following atmospheric dilution. EPA, on its own initiative,
issued a proposed rule in the 
Federal Register
 of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538), which proposes to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance under the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) the residues of arthropod pheromones resulting from the use of these substances in
solid matrix dispensers with an annual application rate limitation of 150 grams AI/acre/year for pest control in
or on all raw agricultural commodities. However, until this exemption from the requirements of a tolerance becomes
a final rule (anticipated in February 1994), a temporary tolerance and EUP application will be required if the treated
crop enters channels of trade. A final rule establishing an exemption from the requirements of a tolerance for inert
ingredients of retrievably sized semiochemical dispensers composed of polymeric matrix materials was published
in the 
Federal Register
 of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64493). 
V. Ecological Effects 
Wildlife toxicity data indicate: high toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and moderate toxicity to fish, but practically
no toxicity to birds tested. Data for one Lepidopteran pheromone indicate low toxicity to avian bobwhite quail (acute
oral LD
50
 of >2,000 mg/kg of body weight and dietary LC
50
 of >5,000 mg/kg). However, this pheromone had a freshwater aquatic invertebrate (Daphnia magna) LC
50
 of between the solubility limit of 0.2 mg/l and a calculated LC
50
 of 0.58 mg/l. Observations of oily surface films at higher test concentrations confirmed the low solubility of the
test material. The conclusion was that this pheromone was highly toxic to Daphnia and that the calculated LC
50
 supported this conclusion. Whether the mortality was due to the pheromone in solution or a film on the water was not
determined. Another Lepidopteran pheromone was found to be moderately toxic to both Daphnia magna (LC
50
 8.6 mg/l) and the freshwater rainbow trout (LC
50
 5.9 mg/l). These results are sufficient to demonstrate the potential toxicity of Lepidopteran pheromones to nontarget
aquatic organisms. 
Although pheromones may be in matrix dispensers, rates of dissociation from matrices into water are not known. Refined
petroleum oils which form films at the water surface are registered by the Agency as pesticides for control of mosquito
larvae and pupae. Pesticidal oils, which may comprise some of these products, kill by arresting invertebrate respiration
and affect interfacial tension at the water surface upon which various arthropods depend for functions including
feeding, movement, and reproduction. To minimize the potential toxic effects on aquatic organisms, the pheromone
formulations in solid polymeric matrix retrievably sized dispensers should be for terrestrial use only and the experimental
use should not include use in or around marshes, swamps, rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, estuaries, flood plains,
or drainage ditches. They should not be allowed to wash or drain into water. 
Despite the toxicity to aquatic organisms from pheromones, EPA believes that risks to aquatic organisms for tests
conducted under the conditions outlined in this notice are low. Pheromones in solid matrix dispensers would not be
expected to be used in water. In addition, many of the solid matrix dispensers of the type covered by this policy are
typically affixed to trees or plants or other fixed objects, and thus, are not likely to end up in bodies of water. 
Broadcast application is not included in this notice because the Agency does not have sufficient information on the
levels of exposure from pheromones which are broadcast. 
VI. Solid Matrix Dispensers 
Solid matrix dispensers, as defined in this notice, include, but are not limited to: Rubber septa dispensers, trilaminate
sheets, tapes, tags, wafers, macrocapillary devices, such as long tubes or fibers, twist ties, or ropes which are
placed by hand in the field and are of such and construction that they are readily seen. This policy does not apply to
the following formulations: Liquid flowables, microcapsules, microcapillary straws, granular powder, flakes,
or confetti formulations which are sprayed or broadcast over an area; and cigarette filters or unprotected ropes
which generally contain the active ingredient on the outer surface of the unit. The dispensers must not be of a size,
odor, taste or have other characteristics making them attractive to wildlife that potentially could collect or eat
them. Devices like netting, webbing, loose filaments, and adhesives capable of trapping or ensnaring nontarget
organisms such as birds also would not be covered by this policy. If inadvertently eaten, these dispensers should
be nontoxic and readily pass through an animal digestive system without causing blockage or puncture. 
VII. Agency Determinations
EPA has determined, pursuant to 40 CFR 172.3, to expand the land use limitation for testing for pesticidal value without
the need for an EUP from 10 acres to 250 acres for arthropod pheromones in solid matrix dispensers using no more than
150 grams AI/acre/year. This determination is based both on a finding that tests conducted under the conditions outlined
will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment and on EPA's belief that it is necessary to test pheromones
in solid matrix dispensers on large acreages (i.e., larger than 10 acres) to determine their value for pesticidal
purposes. EPA retains the authority under 40 CFR 172.3 to require EUP's, on a case-by-case basis, for tests conducted
on acreages smaller than 250 acres if EPA determines that the test is not being conducted only for the purpose of determining
the pheromone's value for pesticidal purposes or if EPA determines that the test may cause unreasonable adverse effects
on the environment in the absence of agency oversight in the form of an EUP. 
Today's notice only addresses EPA's policy with regard to EUP's for pheromones in solid matrix dispensers. This notice
does not in any way obviate the need to obtain a tolerance under the FFDCA before using a pheromone product for food or
feed use. EPA intends to address use of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers on food or feed crops with an exemption
from the requirement for a tolerance under FFDCA. Such a proposed exemption was published in the 
Federal Register
 of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538). Moreover, EPA has published a final rule exempting certain inert ingredients used
in solid matrix dispensers from the requirement of tolerance (December 8, 1993, 58 FR 64493). 
Today's notice in no way affects the need to obtain an EUP for tests conducted on more than 10 acres with formulations
of pheromones products other than those described in the notice (i.e., pheromone formulations which are physically
smaller than solid matrix dispensers, such as sprayables). EUP's will continue to be required for tests conducted
on more than 10 acres using non-solid matrix dispenser formulations. 
EPA currently is considering whether to take additional actions to grant further regulatory relief for other types
of pheromone products. If EPA determines that any such regulatory relief is warranted, EPA would announce such a decision
in a future 
Federal Register
 notice.
