NHTSA is considering applying this approach to light vehicles by proposing both a requirement mandating the installation
of ABSs on light vehicles and road tests that serve as a check on the performance of the ABS. The agency requests comments
about the possible benefits and shortcomings of using this approach for light vehicles.
7. In developing the proposed definition for "ABS" in the heavy vehicle rulemaking, NHTSA referred to the definitions
of "ABS" adopted by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the Economic Commission for Europe's (ECE) Regulation
13, Annex 13 (1988). Based on these definitions and other considerations, the agency proposed the following definition
of "antilock brake system" in the heavy vehicle rulemaking:
a portion of a service brake system that automatically controls the degree of rotational wheel slip during braking
by:
(1) sensing the rate of angular rotation of the wheels;
(2) transmitting signals regarding the rate of wheel angular rotation to one or more devices which interpret those
signals and generate responsive controlling output signals; and
(3) transmitting those controlling signals to one or more devices which adjust brake actuating forces in response
to those signals.
Under this definition describing fundamental and necessary performance aspects that any braking system must have
to be considered an ABS, the agency believes that any ABS would be permitted, provided that it is a "closed loop" system
that ensures feedback between what is actually happening at the tire-road surface interface and what the device is
doing to respond to impending wheel lockup.
The agency requests comments about whether to apply to light vehicles the approach proposed to improve the lateral
stability and control of heavy vehicles. Is it necessary and appropriate to supplement the combination of a definition
of "ABS" and an equipment requirement with one or more "check" tests to ensure the lateral stability and control
of light vehicles? Is the definition of "ABS," as proposed in the heavy vehicle NPRM, appropriate for light vehicles?
What are the advantages or disadvantages of a requirement expressly mandating an ABS instead of taking the more indirect
approach of adopting dynamic tests? Notwithstanding the agency's tentative conclusion that the proposed definition
for heavy vehicle "ABS" is sufficiently broad to allow a variety of ABSs, the agency welcomes comment about the use
of this definition for light vehicles. Would it ensure suitable stopping distances and cover all appropriate brake
designs, while not unnecessarily prohibiting brake systems that effectively prevent wheel lockup in a sufficiently
wide variety of circumstances?
D. Test Procedures
8. In the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking, NHTSA proposed that such vehicles would have to comply with a braking-in-a-curve
test, but decided not to propose additional tests such as a split mu test or a lane change test. The agency believed that
such additional tests would be impracticable for heavy vehicles given the criteria set forth in 
PACCAR. 
Notwithstanding the agency's tentative decision in the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking to propose only a braking-in-a-curve
test, the agency is seeking comment on whether to require that light vehicles be capable of stopping without loss-of-control
in the following test maneuvers:
(a) While turning on a low mu surface;
(b) While stopping on a straight line split mu surface;
(c) While in transition from a high mu surface to a low mu surface; and
(d) While in transition from a low mu surface to a high mu surface.
