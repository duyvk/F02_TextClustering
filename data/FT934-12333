FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Leeds/N&P
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arthur Daley character employed in the Leeds' commercials has, it seems,
been stung by National & Provincial's bee. The differences in culture
between the two building societies proved irreconcilable. Given the proposed
merger was born of desire rather than desperation, it was wise to call a
halt before it grew too serious. The merger's rationale depended on some
painful rationalisation, which could only have worked had there been
complete harmony of purpose. Leeds will resume its search for a chief
executive and, perhaps, for a new merger partner. It seems likely to settle
for a more conventional manager than Mr David O'Brien and a less risky
partner than N&P.
