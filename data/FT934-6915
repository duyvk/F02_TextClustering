FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Sparks fly in steel clash - Issue is
deadlocked

The row over steel between the US and the European Union is expected to be
one of the most contentious items addressed by Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU
trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in their
Washington talks which began yesterday.
The issue threatens to pose a serious obstacle to a wide-ranging package of
market-opening measures for industrial goods in the Uruguay Round of global
trade talks, due to end on December 15.
Negotiators from 36 leading steel producers meeting in Geneva last week
failed to make progress in negotiating a multilateral steel agreement (MSA),
on which a provisionally agreed zero-tariff deal for steel depends.
Zero tariffs for steel are a hefty slice of the value to the EU of the US
tariff offer, without which officials say the deal would be seriously
unbalanced.
The MSA talks are deadlocked over US insistence that allowable subsidies,
such as those for environmental improvement, plant closure and research and
development, should be actionable under domestic anti-subsidy laws. The MSA
as drafted would outlaw most subsidies to the industry, alongside a 10-year
phase-out of tariff and non-tariff barriers to steel trade.
The EU and others, still smarting from a string of anti-dumping and
countervailing duty suits on their exports brought by the US steel industry
last year (most of them later rejected), want strong MSA provisions to
prevent further harassment and immediate agreement to lift duties.
Both sides have made limited gestures of flexibility but a sticking point
has been Washington's refusal to deny its steel industry the right to
petition the government for action.
A senior US official said a new working draft would be presented to the next
MSA meeting in December, but expressed little optimism.
