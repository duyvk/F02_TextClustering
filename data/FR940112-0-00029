&bull;Amend Sect.404.510 to provide that in determining whether an 
individual is without fault with respect to a title II deduction 
overpayment, we will consider all pertinent circumstances, 
including an individual's age and intelligence and any physical, 
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations of the individual 
(including any lack of facility with the English language). In 
addition, to eliminate any ambiguity with respect to the 
application of the amendment to section 204(b) of the Act made by 
section 10305(b) of OBRA 1989 in cases involving title II 
deduction overpayments, the changes to Sect.404.510 will: 
(1) clarify that the situations described in Sect.404.510 in which 
an individual will be considered without fault in connection with 
a deduction overpayment are not all-inclusive; and (2) eliminate 
the provision in paragraph (n) of Sect.404.510 which requires that 
for an individual to be considered without fault with respect to 
a deduction overpayment in certain circumstances described in 
paragraph (n), such individual must have made a bona fide attempt 
to restrict his or her annual earnings or otherwise comply with 
the deduction provisions of the Act. 
&bull;Amend Sect.404.511(b) to show that the Social Security 
Administration generally will not find an individual to be 
without fault when, after having been exonerated for a title II 
"deduction overpayment" and after having been advised of the 
correct interpretation of the deduction provision, the individual 
incurs another "deduction overpayment" under the same 
circumstances as the first overpayment. The change to 
Sect.404.511(b) also explains that in determining "without fault" 
under such circumstances, however, any physical, mental, 
educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of 
facility with the English language) the individual has will be 
taken into consideration. 
&bull;Amend Sect.416.552 to provide that we will take into account 
any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) the 
individual has in determining whether the individual is without 
fault for purposes of the waiver of adjustment or recovery of a 
title XVI overpayment. 
In general, under section 1631(b)(4) of the Act and the 
implementing regulation, Sect.416.556, if any title XVI overpayment 
is attributable solely to the ownership or possession by an 
individual (or by an individual and his or her spouse, if any) of 
countable resources having a value which exceeds, by $50 or less, 
the applicable limitation on resources specified in the Act and 
regulations, such individual (and spouse if any) will be deemed 
to have been without fault in connection with the overpayment, 
and waiver of adjustment or recovery will be made, unless the 
failure to report the value of the excess resources correctly and 
in a timely manner was willful and knowing. Based on the 
amendment to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act made by 
section 10305(e) of OBRA of 1989, we are amending Sect.416.556(b) to 
provide that in determining whether failure to report the excess 
resources correctly and in a timely manner was willful and 
knowing, and, thus, whether the individual was at fault, we will 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) the individual has. 
&bull;Good Faith_Waiver of Recovery of Overpayments_Continuation 
of Disability Benefits Pending Appeal 
Under sections 223(g) and 1631(a)(7) of the Act and the 
implementing regulations at Sect.Sect.404.1597a and 416.996, a title II 
or title XVI beneficiary receiving benefits based on disability 
whom the Secretary determines is no longer disabled based on 
medical factors has the option of having his or her benefits 
continued through a hearing before an administrative law judge 
(ALJ). Benefits paid during this period are considered 
overpayments if the beneficiary loses the appeal. However, if 
the beneficiary acted in good faith in pursuing the appeal, 
repayment can be waived (sections 223(g)(2)(B) and 
1631(a)(7)(B)(ii) of the Act and 404.1597a(j) and 416.996(g) of 
our regulations). Our regulations establish a presumption that 
appeals are made in good faith unless the beneficiary fails, 
without good cause, to cooperate during the appeal.
