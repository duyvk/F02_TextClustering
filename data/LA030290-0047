In the long-running battle among dance-music divas Paula Abdul and Janet 
Jackson for pop-chart supremacy, Abdul continues to reign on the Billboard 
magazine pop album chart. But in the next week or two, Jackson could unseat 
Abdul.

Jackson's "Escapade" single, currently No. 1 on the pop singles' chart, is 
hotter than Abdul's "Opposites Attract" single, which is No. 6 and sliding down 
the chart. Also, Jackson is getting a lot of publicity because of her first 
tour. Buoyed by her Grammy haul, Bonnie Raitt's "Nick of Time" album vaulted 
from No. 40 to No. 22.

* The Polish female vocalist Basia, who sings both soul and Latin-flavored 
songs, is no flash-in-the-pan. "London Warsaw New York," the follow-up to her 
hit debut album, entered the pop chart at No. 149 last week but took a 
stratospheric leap to No. 34.BT 05,2L,27L,9R,9R,8RRankRank 2WeeksTitle
