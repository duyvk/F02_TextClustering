In epidemiology, there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks
of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions for violence against women. Examples of potentially
modifiable risk factors which should be examined for each area are listed below: 
&bull;Attitudes and beliefs which influence violent behavior against women (e.g., Are boys and men who hold attitudes
conducive to violence against women more likely to be violent towards women? What role does culture play in perpetuating
these attitudes?); 
&bull;The impact of early childhood experiences of violence (either as a witness or victim of violence) upon the tendency
to develop violent behavior patterns in adulthood (e.g., What childhood experiences mitigate the harmful effects
on children of witnessing violent acts against women? What role does past exposure to varying forms of violence play
in repeated victimization?); 
&bull;The role of alcohol and other drugs among batterers and their victims; 
&bull;Factors in a dating relationship which precipitate violent behavior (e.g., Are young men who commit violent
acts against a date likely to continue these behaviors?); 
&bull;Factors which precipitate battering during pregnancy. 
Also of programmatic interest is epidemiologic research having as its focus the development of improved methods
for and the evaluation of injury surveillance systems that accurately quantify the incidence and severity of injuries
that result from violence against women (e.g., emergency department-based surveillance of injuries due to violence
against women). Research is needed that more accurately defines the cost of violence against women, from a social,
physical, and psychological perspective (e.g., How does violence against women affect productivity in the workplace?
How does such violence affect the cost of health care in general?).
Cost analysis should be included in the plans, where appropriate, to evaluate an intervention(s) that addresses
violence against women. A more complete discussion of methodologies for assessing cost analysis is presented in,
A Framework for Assessing the Effectiveness of Disease and Injury Prevention, (CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, March 27, 1992, Volume 41, Number RR-3, pages 5-11). (To receive information on these reports
see the section Where To Obtain Additional Information.) 
Evaluation Criteria 
Upon receipt, applications will be screened by CDC staff for completeness and responsiveness as outlined under the
previous heading, Program Requirements (A-F). Incomplete applications and applications that are not responsive
will be returned to the applicant without further consideration. Applications which are complete and responsive
may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by a peer review group to determine if the application is of sufficient
technical and scientific merit to warrant further review; the CDC will withdraw from further consideration applications
judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and the official signing
for the applicant organization. Those applications judged to be competitive will be further evaluated by a dual review
process. The primary review will be a peer evaluation by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC) of the
scientific and technical merit of the application. The final review will be conducted by the CDC Advisory Committee
for Injury Prevention and Control (ACIPC), which will consider the results of the peer review together with program
need and relevance. Funding decisions will be made by the Director, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control
(NCIPC), based on merit and priority score ranking by the IRGRC, program review by the ACIPC, and the availability
of funds. 
A. The first review will be a peer review to be conducted on all applications. Factors to be considered will include:
1. The specific aims of the research project, i.e., the broad long-term objectives, the intended accomplishment
of the specific research proposal, and the hypothesis to be tested; 
2. The background of the proposal, i.e., the basis for the present proposal, the critical evaluation of existing knowledge,
and specific identification of the injury control knowledge gaps which the proposal is intended to fill; 
3. The significance and originality from a scientific or technical standpoint of the specific aims of the proposed
research, including the adequacy of the theoretical and conceptual framework for the research;
