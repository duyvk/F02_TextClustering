Italy's fast-expanding trading links with non-EC countries received a boost
yesterday with two joint ventures between the Pirelli tyres and cables group
and state-owned partners in China, Haig Simonian in Milan writes.
The first involves a new L100bn (Dollars 63m) tyre plant to supply the
rapidly growing Chinese automotive market. The new Beijing plant will have
an initial capacity of 1.4m tyres a year. Pirelli will supply technical
expertise. The second deal involves a new factory at Houma in Shanxi
province to manufacture copper and fibre optic telecommunications cables.
