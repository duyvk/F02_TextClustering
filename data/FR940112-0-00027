&bull;Fraudulent Behavior or Failure To Cooperate or To Take 
Any Required Action in Disability Determinations 
Under sections 223(f) and 1614(a)(4) of the Act, title II or 
title XVI disability benefits may be terminated if a prior 
favorable determination of disability was fraudulently obtained 
or if the beneficiary fails, without good cause, to cooperate 
with the Secretary in reviewing his or her entitlement or to 
follow prescribed treatment which is expected to restore his or 
her ability to work. 
Section 10305(c) of OBRA 1989 amended section 223(f) of the 
Act to provide that in making, for purposes of section 223(f), 
any determination or decision relating to fraudulent behavior by 
any individual or failure by any individual without good cause to 
cooperate or to take any required action, the Secretary shall 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) the individual may have. In addition, with 
respect to making similar determinations and decisions for 
purposes of section 1614(a)(4) of the Act, section 1631(c)(1) of 
title XVI of the Act, as amended by OBRA 1989, requires the 
Secretary to take these limitations into account in determining 
whether an individual acted in good faith or was at fault, and in 
determining fraud, deception, or intent. 
Sections 404.1518, 404.1530, 404.1579, 404.1594, 416.918, 
416.930, 416.994 and 416.994a reflect the pertinent provisions of 
sections 223(f) and 1614(a)(4) of the Act. We are making the 
following changes in these regulations: 
&bull;Amend Sect.Sect.404.1518 and 416.918 to provide that we will take 
into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) the individual has when determining if the individual 
has a good reason for failing to attend a consultative 
examination which we have arranged for the individual. These 
specific amendments were not included in the NPRM. Current 
Sect.Sect.404.1518 and 416.918 provide that we may determine that an 
individual who is applying for benefits based on disability or 
blindness is not disabled or blind, or that an individual who is 
entitled to or eligible for benefits based on disability or 
blindness is no longer disabled or blind, if we find that the 
individual failed or refused to attend a consultative examination 
without a good reason. While Sect.Sect.404.1518 and 416.918 provide 
rules for determining whether an individual has a good reason for 
such failure or refusal and, thus, are within the scope of the 
amendments to sections 223(f) and 1631(c)(1) of the Act, we 
inadvertently failed to include these regulations when we 
developed the proposed regulations to implement section 10305 of 
OBRA 1989. We are amending Sect.Sect.404.1518(a) and 416.918(a) in the 
final rule to make it clear that we will consider an individual's 
physical, mental, educational, and linguistic limitations 
(including any lack of facility with the English language) in 
determining whether the individual has a good reason for failing 
to attend a consultative examination. In connection with this 
change, we also are making related changes, which were not in the 
NPRM, to Sect.Sect.404.1579(e)(2), 404.1586(d), 404.1594(e)(2), 
416.986(c), 416.994(b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a(g)(2) to include in 
these sections a cross-reference to Sect.404.1518 or Sect.416.918, as 
appropriate, to clarify that Sect.Sect.404.1518 and 416.918 provide the 
rules for determining whether an individual has a good reason for 
not attending a consultative examination. Current 
Sect.416.994a(g)(2) already contains such a cross-reference. 
&bull;Amend Sect.Sect.404.1530(c) and 416.930(c) to provide that we will 
take into account any physical, mental, educational, or 
linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the 
English language) the individual has when deciding if the 
individual has acceptable reasons for failure to follow 
prescribed treatment. 
&bull;Amend Sect.Sect.404.1579 (e)(1) and (e)(2), 404.1594 (e)(1) and 
(e)(2), 416.994 (b)(4)(i) and (b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a (g)(1) and 
(g)(2) to indicate that we will take into account any physical, 
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any 
lack of facility with the English language) the individual has in 
determining whether a prior favorable determination or decision 
was fraudulently obtained or in determining whether an individual 
has good cause for failure to supply evidence we ask for or to go 
for a physical or mental examination. The amendments to these 
sections of the regulations include certain technical changes 
that were not reflected in the NPRM. For the final rule, we are 
adding the phrase "or decision" to Sect.Sect.404.1579(e)(1), 
404.1594(e)(1), 416.994(b)(4)(i) and 416.994a(g)(1) to clarify 
that these provisions apply not only to determinations we make, 
but also to decisions we make. Section 416.994a(g)(1) already 
contains this language. Also, as discussed above, 
Sect.Sect.404.1579(e)(2), 404.1586(d), 404.1594(e)(2), 416.986(c), 
416.994(b)(4)(ii) and 416.994a(g)(2) of the final rule include a 
cross-reference to Sect.404.1518 or Sect.416.918, as appropriate, which 
provides rules for determining whether an individual has good 
cause for failing to attend a consultative examination.
