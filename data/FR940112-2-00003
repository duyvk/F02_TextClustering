SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, "Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests," require a person to obtain a permit before
introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically
engineered organisms and products that are considered "regulated articles." The regulations set forth procedures
for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit
for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. 
Pursuant to these regulations, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received and is reviewing the following
applications for permits to release genetically engineered organisms into the environment:
