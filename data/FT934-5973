FT  26 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy gets support at German
expense

Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers, increased
Italy's weighting in the broker's pan-European portfolio yesterday by 3
percentage points to 8.2 per cent against a benchmark 5.3 per cent, writes
Our Markets Staff. This came at the expense of Germany, which is now at 13
per cent against a 15.5 per cent benchmark.
He said that the move reflected as much concern with valuation levels in
Germany, as exploiting Italian opportunities. 'The lack of sensitivity to
movements in short term rates will make the transition from an interest rate
driven market to an earnings driven market difficult for Germany next year,'
he maintained.
But in Italy, the trend of inflation had improved continuously, while a
L8,300bn trade deficit in the first seven months of 1992 had been converted
into an equivalent surplus this year. Mr Rooney saw Italian bonds and the
lira at current levels, supported by these trends, as fundamentally cheap.
Politics remained the joker although any government resulting from next
year's general elections would be better than the series of administrations
that had dragged down the Italian economy over the past two decades.
Mr Rooney had reservations about the stock market, stemming from the
inability to explain its performance in terms of fundamentals, inadequate
dividend growth, and the fact that the transformation of the political and
economic landscape has not been replicated in the corporate sector. 'The
difference is that the market has underperformed in both local and common
currency terms by around 11.5 per cent so far this year and the economic
fundamentals have improved,' he said.
PARIS was bemused by trading in Euro Disney which fluctuated wildly, being
suspended limit down twice, then gaining some 20 per cent in value from its
nadir, before being suspended once more; it finally closed FFr2.20, or 7 per
cent higher at FFr29.40 in turnover of some FFr158m.
With its small weighting in the CAC-40 the price movement had minimal effect
on the index, which raced ahead to end up 47.79 or 2.3 per cent at 2,118.40.
Turnover was estimated at FFr3.7bn. It was suggested that short-covering was
partly behind the market's climb yesterday, with domestic investors taking
advantage of the absence of US institutions to become aggressive buyers.
AMSTERDAM was pulled higher in line with other bourses, the CBS Tendency
index adding 2.4 or 1.8 per cent to 135.7. Turnover was estimated to have
been around Fl 1bn, helped by strength on the options market.
Cyclicals returned to favour, DSM and Akzo showing respective rises of Fl
4.00 and Fl 3.00 to Fl 102.20 and Fl 178.80; good buying was also noted
among financials.
Further strength was seen in KNP BT, the paper group, following Wednesday's
results which were not as bad as some analysts had been forecasting: the
shares rose Fl 1.50 to Fl 41.70. Royal Dutch went against the trend,
slipping Fl 2.10 to Fl 195.60, partly on a weaker oil price.
FRANKFURT climbed on the Volkswagen four-day week agreement, and extended
its gains after hours after Bavaria came in with a drop in its year on year
inflation rate to mid-November. The DAX rose 18.16 to 2,047.71 and the
Ibis-indicated index by another 10.09 in the afternoon to 2,057.80.
Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.5bn with VW accounting for DM980m of that,
far ahead of its average volume. The four-day week was estimated to be worth
a 20 per cent reduction in the carmaker's costs, the shares rose DM9.50 to
DM412 and, in a generally strong automotive sector, Daimler continued its
recovery with a rise of DM12.20 to DM717.
The big results of the day came from Bayer. The prospect of an 18 per cent
fall in 1993 pre-tax profits was less severe than expected, yet the shares
rose only DM1.90 to DM324.50 during the session compared with DM2.70 to
DM278.70 for Hoechst and DM5.10 to DM268.40 for BASF. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok,
head of research at James Capel in Frankfurt, observed that Bayer had been
expected to produce better results than the other big two chemical stocks,
which had underperformed the market in the first three weeks of November,
while Bayer had outperformed.
The bad results came from Metallgesellschaft, where heavy losses, no
dividend and the prospect of a rights issue supported by a defensive coterie
of big corporate shareholders left analysts shaking their heads in despair.
STOCKHOLM saw volatile trading in Volvo after major shareholders said that
they would back the proposed merger between the Swedish group and Renault of
France. The B shares, which had been trading at a high of SKr431 before the
announcement, fell back, closing off SKr3 at SKr407.
The Affarsvarlden general index added 2.0 to 1,314.0.
MILAN continued higher with sentiment helped by signs that the government
had won political consensus on the need to see the budget approved by the
end of the year. The Comit index rose 9.79 or 1.9 per cent to 536.06.
Fiat, firm on Wednesday after it announced plans for redundancies and
temporary lay-offs, bounced L235 or 6.6 per cent higher to L3,800 after
demand by domestic funds sparked short covering. Speculation that the car
group was thinking of selling Alfa Romeo was firmly denied by Fiat.
Sip, L63 higher at L3,029, Olivetti, L25 firmer at L1,805, and Pirelli, L89
ahead at L1,849, continued to pick up ground lost earlier in the week.
Benetton surged L1,140 or 5.4 per cent to L22,290 on the view that the
cheaper lira could help its exports.
MADRID was given a breathing space as the holiday closure in the US took
American sellers out of the market. The general index closed 2.27 higher at
296.78 in turnover down from Pta37.2bn to Pta20.6bn.
Electrical utilities rose in depth, led by Fenosa, up Pta14 at Ptta534, and
Iberdrola, Pta16 better Pta896. Telefonica, which said on Wednesday that it
was well set for Europe-wide competitition in telephone networks, rose Pta30
to Pta1,665.
ZURICH was firmer, but off the day's highs, with activity restrained by the
absence of US investors. The SMI index rose 9.0 to 2,726.8.
Nestle continued higher after Wednesday's 10 month figures, the shares
adding SFr6 to SFr1,185.
Swissair added another SFr9 to SFr756, only SFr4 short of its price ahead of
last weekend's announcement that the Alcazar talks had been called off.
Banks were broadly higher with CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, gaining
SFr40 to SFr3,455.
COPENHAGEN dropped 2 per cent on late selling in thin trading, the KFX index
losing 2.01 to 99.41.
ATHENS was unsettled by reports that the government planned to increase
taxes on share dividends by up to 10 per cent. The story was later denied.
The general index dropped by 13.73 to 851.98.
ISTANBUL hit a new record high on late buying, which left the composite
index up 473.5, or 2.8 per cent, at 17,195.1.
Buying interest concentrated on the iron and steel, cement and banking
sectors, with Eregli rising TL300 to TL6,500.
Turnover was estimated at TL1,400bn.
