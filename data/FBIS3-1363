  [Text] President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has strongly condemned 
the killings in Burundi, which were carried out by soldiers 
against unarmed citizens. He said that they should cease what 
they are doing immediately. In talks with a special envoy of 
President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi, who delivered a message 
this evening at State House in Dar es Salaam, President Mwinyi 
said that the Tanzanians had received the reports about the 
continued killings in Burundi with a great deal of sadness. He 
said that the government could not remain silent while such 
injustices continued to be perpetrated in a neighboring country. 
  He said that, under any circumstances, whatever happened in 
Burundi affected Tanzania and other neighboring countries. He 
said that it was for this reason that he had contacted the 
leaders of the east and central African countries to seek an 
urgent solution, in cooperation with the OAU. 
  For his part, the Burundian envoy, Mr. Severin Mfatiye, who 
is also the ambassador of Burundi in Rwanda, briefed President 
Mwinyi at length about the grave and deplorable security 
situation in Burundi.
