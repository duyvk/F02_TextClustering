MANUFACTURING GROWTH OF .9% FORECAST FOR '91; 
</P>
<P>

HOWEVER.

Industry will continue to grow slowly in 1991 as export activity helps to 
counteract economic weakness at home, the Commerce Department said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the manufacturing sector will grow 0.9% next year, compared to about 
1% this year, the department said in its annual Industrial Outlook, which 
covers 350 U.S. industries. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has been slumping for some time, and Michael Farren, 
undersecretary for international trade, said service industries will continue 
to outperform the manufacturing sector next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest sign of manufacturing weakness, the Commerce Department said 
orders for big-ticket durable goods plunged a record-tying 10.5% in November. 
Such weakness is seen as evidence that the economy has entered a recession that 
is expected to last at least through the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Commerce Department survey shows plenty of bright spots in 
the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
High-technology industries will continue to do well, particularly computers and 
semiconductors, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other fast-growing industries, the report listed surgical and medical 
material, medicines, poultry processing, aircraft, dental equipment and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Those expected to lose ground include mobile homes, boat building and repair, 
creamery butter and frozen bakery products, motors and generators, sawmills and 
electric housewares. 
</P>
<P>
"Exports will provide an important source of vitality for many industries, 
partially counteracting weaknesses in other elements of the U.S. economy," 
Farren said. 
</P>
<P>
Other projected growth areas include aircraft, engines and parts, and machine 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
Of machine tools, Farren said: "This is an indication that businesses will 
continue to invest in new equipment needed to raise efficiency and productivity 
in today's increasingly competitive environment." 
</P>
<P>
More than 60% of the industries surveyed should grow, and they represent about 
75% of all manufacturers, Farren said. 
</P>
<P>
But, "on the negative side, two major segments of the economy -- construction 
and motor vehicles -- are again expected to decline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those weaknesses would affect the economy broadly. They have a slowing 
influence on steel, building materials, household durables, wood products and 
other industries. 
</P>
<P>
Farren predicted that the 1990 trade deficit will be $105 billion -- and 1991's 
shortfall about the same -- due to higher oil prices triggered by the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 deficit was $109 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Farren said the department estimated overall 1991 growth at 1% to 3%, with the 
mostly likely outcome 1.3% to 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development recently 
projected U.S. growth for 1991 at 0.9%.
