<DOCTITLE>Report of Computer Matching Program Between Department of Labor and Department of Health and Human Services, Social
Security Administration</DOCTITLE>
Participating agencies: 
The participating agencies in this computer matching program are the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,
Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration (SSA).
This Notice is published as required by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as amended. A new
written agreement for this long-standing computer matching program recently has been approved by both the Department
of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services Data Integrity Boards. 
Purpose of match: 
DOL will conduct a computer matching program of DOL and SSA records of Black Lung benefit recipients in order to detect
individuals who might improperly receive dual Black Lung benefits from SSA and DOL. When a verified match occurs,
the case will be referred to the proper DOL office for development to assure the validity of the match and to make any
required benefit adjustments. The SSA data will contain the date of death of SSA beneficiaries. This information
will help to minimize those cases in which benefit payments are made to deceased beneficiaries, by identifying a DOL
beneficiary who has died, but DOL has not been notified of the death. The SSA data also will assist DOL in properly referring
inquiries and correspondence received at DOL regarding SSA-only Black Lung beneficiaries. 
Authority for conducting the matching program: 
Title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, 30 U.S.C. 901, et seq.
Categories of records and individuals covered: 
SSA, as the source agency, will provide DOL with its Black Lung Payment System, HHS/SSA/OSR 09-60-0045,
(52 FR 9543, March 25, 1987), which will be matched with DOL's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs' Black Lung
Benefit Payment records contained in DOL/ESA-30 (55 FR 7131, February 28, 1990). The individuals covered will
be DOL and SSA Black Lung beneficiaries. 
Inclusive dates of the matching program: 
The Matching program will begin either 30 days after the publication date of this Notice, or 30 days after a copy of the
written agreement for this matching program is sent to the Chairman of the Committee on Government Affairs of the U.S.
Senate, to the Chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, and to the Director of the Office of Management
and Budget, whichever is later. The matching program will continue for 18 months from the beginning date and may be
extended for an additional 12 months thereafter.
