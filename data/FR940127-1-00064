13. Bigleaf Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla)
American mahogany, the genus 
Swietenia,
 is native to the neotropics (56 FR 33898-33899, July 24, 1991). Two of the three species in this genus are listed
in CITES Appendix II: 
Swietenia humilis 
(Pacific Coast mahogany) including its parts and derivatives, which occurs in Mexico and Central America; and 
Swietenia mahagoni 
(Caribbean mahogany) including only its logs, sawn wood, and veneer, which occurs on some Caribbean islands and extends
to southern Florida. The unlisted species, 
Swietenia macrophylla 
(bigleaf mahogany), occurs from South America to Mexico; it apparently forms hybrids naturally with 
S. humilis 
 in Costa Rica. In the Carribean, 
S. mahagoni
 seems to have crossed spontaneously with introduced 
S. macrophylla 
to form hybrids that have been called 
S. aubrevilleana. Swietenia 
species and hybrids also are in cultivation (and may be locally naturalized); some are grown ornamentally and/or
silviculturally. 
Swietenia macrophylla 
and 
S. mahagoni 
are grown with limited success in plantations in the tropics of the New and Old Worlds.
At COP8, Costa Rica and the United States proposed to include 
Swietenia macrophylla 
and its natural hybrid in Appendix II; the U.S. proposal excluded the Old World populations and secondary and final
products (e.g., finished products and derivatives). In a preliminary meeting during COP8, all the range States except
three (Bolivia, Peru and Honduras) tentatively supported the listing. Costa Rica decided to support the U.S. proposal.
However, because of lack of sufficient consensus, the United States withdrew its proposal (cf. 57 FR 20443, May 13,
1992).
In response to the July 15, 1993, notice (58 FR 38112) that initiated listing preparations for COP9, the Natural Resources
Defense Council provided a new extensive draft proposal to include the neotropical populations of 
Swietenia macrophylla
 and its natural hybrid in Appendix II, including only the timber and wood processed to the first stage of transformation
(i.e., primary products), such as logs, wood in the rough, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and plywood. The September 1993
meeting of the CITES Plants Committee favored submission of a proposal for this species.
The Service regards the available information and data sufficient to support reproposing this species and its natural
hybrid, and believes that there is increasing understanding of the consequences and value of its regulation under
CITES Appendix II. The United States has become the main importer of this species, and the Service plans to provide
a draft proposal to the range States for their comments. Information is desired particularly on populations that
are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation.
14. African Mahoganies
The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society provided draft proposals to list the African mahoganies in Appendix II.
African mahoganies include the genera 
Entandrophragma 
(about 11 species) and 
Khaya 
(about 6 species), which are native to the tropics of Africa, with 
Khaya 
extending to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Some of the 17 species are in cultivation, including some silvicultural
plantations. The majority of the species have some legal protection in one or more countries, generally with respect
to their export. All of the species have been declining due to habitat conversion and selectively varied commercial
exploitation, and nearly all of them have been reported to be threatened in various countries and significant portions
of their ranges.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has recognized the need to conserve most 
Khaya 
and some 
Entandrophragma 
species, being concerned with their genetic erosion. The September 1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee reviewed
draft proposals for these genera, and favored the circulation of these drafts for their possible submission. In November
1993, Germany circulated them to the range States for their views. The Service may join with Germany's initiative,
or provide draft proposals to the range States by April 1994 for their comments. Information is desired particularly
on populations of each species that are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation.
