  [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] was 
shocked by the execution of wounded AWB members by a 
Bophuthatswana soldier on Friday [11 March], a spokesman at AWB 
headquarters said. AWB spokesman Fred Rundle said AWB leader 
Eugene Terreblanche was not immediately available for comment. 
  Observers feared the incident could lead to acts of 
retribution and increasing violence. 
  REUTER photographer Kevin Carter said he saw the AWB men 
plead for their lives, crying "please God help us" before a 
Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] soldier, ignoring his 
comrades protests, took aim and shot them dead. He also pumped 
bullets into the dead body of a third AWB member lying next to 
them. 
  The three AWB men had been ambushed in the centre of 
Mmabatho 
in their green Mercedes car. 
  Mr Rundle said he had received reports that five other AWB 
men had been injured in other incidents. 
  South African security sources said the incident showed the 
AWB should have employed better military tactics when they 
entered Mmabatho, moving around in larger groups and using 
better communications. They also said the AWB men probably did 
not expect the BDF to turn on them, if this is what happened.
