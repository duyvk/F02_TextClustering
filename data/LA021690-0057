A study of airline-cabin environment found that, even with the smoking ban that 
takes effect Feb. 25, passengers and crew still face a health risk from 
increased radiation from the sun and stars. The study released by the 
Department of Transportation recommends airlines schedule cabin crews in ways 
that will reduce their risk to cosmic radiation, especially those crews who 
regularly fly near the North Pole and South Pole or at higher altitudes.

The study found the risk of cancer death from cosmic radiation comparable to 
the risk of death from exposure to smoke-filled cabins. In addition to risks 
facing crew members, the study noted a risk to frequent fliers and to the 
fetuses of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy.
