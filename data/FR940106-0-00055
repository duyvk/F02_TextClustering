We believe that these revisions are essential to the effective implementation of the CLIA program, and to delay the
effective date would potentially disrupt public access to laboratory services, unnecessarily expose laboratories
to greater costs than are needed to help assure quality testing, and create unnecessary confusion among laboratories
in understanding the standards they must meet. Without immediate revision of the regulations, we believe there may
be shortages of cytotechnologists in some areas resulting in limited access to cytology services. Therefore, we
believe it is contrary to the public interest to go through a notice-and-comment procedure, and we find good cause
to waive the notice of proposed rulemaking and to issue this final rule on an interim basis. For these same reasons,
we find there is good cause to dispense with a delayed effective date of these regulations. Although the regulations
are final and effective on the date of publication, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment. 
IV. Regulatory Impact Statement 
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all laboratories are considered to be small entities.
Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
This final rule with comment period revises personnel requirements for cytotechnologists by extending the dates
by which they must meet the qualification requirements. We are unable to quantify the number of individuals, laboratories,
or rural hospitals affected by this rule. In the laboratory industry generally, recent surveys indicate that 80 percent
of U.S. laboratories have experienced a shortage of technical personnel. A shortage of cytotechnologists throughout
the United States has been demonstrated through anecdotal studies of wages and vacancy rates. According to the American
Hospital Association's 1991 Survey of Human Resources, there was a full-time equivalent vacancy rate of 12.2 percent
for cytotechnologists in hospital laboratories. The survey also reported that more than 60 days were required to
fill almost two-thirds of the full-time vacancies. The average length of time required to fill approximately half
of the full-time vacancies was over 90 days. This scarcity level existed prior to the imposition of Federal personnel
standards that might lead to lesser numbers of qualified cytotechnologists.
