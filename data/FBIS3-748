Bophuthatswana on 12 March on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] The Bophuthatswana authorities announced today that 
murder charges will brought against those allegedly responsible 
for the execution of two members of the AWB [Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement], after a 
confrontation with the Bophuthatswana Security Forces in 
Mmabatho on Friday [11 March]. Major-General Jack Turner, chief 
of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF), said a full-scale 
investigation had been launched to identify the killers and to 
bring them to justice. If necessary, the investigation would be 
broadened to include independent participation. 
  General Turner said: "We are filled with revulsion at this 
horrific incident. This sort of summary and barbaric action 
forms no part of the protective and peacekeeping role for which 
the security forces of this country are responsible and we are 
duty- bound to bring the culprits to book. We are now studying 
video film material taken at the scene by TV media personnel 
prior to the shooting incident, to see if this can materially 
assist us with the investigation and to identify the 
perpetrators. We are also appealing to those who have 
information which could assist us with the investigation to come 
forward as soon as possible. Their information will be treated 
in the strictest confidence. We would like this murder 
investigation to be as transparent and open as the law will 
permit. I can give the categoric assurance that once we have 
ascertained all the relevant facts, a murder docket will be 
opened by the Bophuthatswana Police and the alleged killer or 
killers will be brought before the courts as soon as possible." 
  General Turner also announced that strong disciplinary 
action, including legal prosecutions if warranted, would be 
taken against those members of the security forces who had 
allegedly been involved in the harassment and assault of members 
of the media, while they were carrying out their professional 
duties. General Turner said no stone would be left unturned in 
identifying the culprits. Members of the media who wished to 
provide information which could assist with this inquiry, as 
well the investigation into the shooting incident involving the 
AWB members, could contact him on: tel: (0140) 861828 fax: 
(0140) 863419. 
  With reference to the presence and deployment of AWB 
contingents inside Bophuthatswana this week, General Turner 
emphasised that these AWB members had been operating inside the 
country without the consent of the Bophuthatswana authorities, 
and had not consulted or liaised with the security forces as to 
their entry into the country. General Turner said that late on 
Thursday evening, he had been alerted to the fact that 
heavily-armed AWB members in bakkies [pickup trucks] had 
assembled at Rooigrond, about 20kms from Mmabatho, under the 
command of AWB leader, Eugene Terreblance. He had instructed 
Colonel Manne Botes of the BDF to proceed to Rooigrond to tell 
Mr Terreblance that his forces were not welcome in 
Bophuthatswana and to immediately withdraw his men, as well as 
those already in Mmabatho itself. Mr Terreblance's reaction was 
that he "did not take orders from colonels." 
  "Subsequently, Mr Terreblance was accompanied to Mmabatho 
where I personally made it clear to him that he and his men 
should leave the country immediately as their presence here 
would create friction and pose problems for us. In addition, I 
told him that our security forces were dead set against the 
presence of the AWB in Bophuthatswana. Mr Terreblance was 
visibly upset and claimed that his offer of assistance was being 
spurned, but after lengthy discussions, he agreed to leave with 
his men. Regrettably, he reneged on this undertaking, and we 
later received several reports of incidents in which AWB members 
were involved in random shooting forays, as well as harassing 
troops and making racial insults. All this had the effect of 
increasing tensions and stirring up deep emotions among the 
local public and the security forces." 
  General Turner added that on Friday, while BDF troops were 
on 
parade at the Molopo military base in Mmabatho, the AWB had 
deployed in the veld outside the base and had opened fire on his 
men. Fortunately, no-one had been hurt. The overall situation 
had also been aggravated by the fact that unidentified elements 
in RSA [Republic of South Africa]-registered cars had been 
cruising the streets of Mmabatho/Mafikeng, firing at random on 
civilian homes and properties with automatic weapons. 
  General Turner said that once agreement had been reached to 
allow the SADF [South African Defense Force], the BDF and the 
Bophuthatswana Police to conduct joint security operations 
within Bophuthatswana, these forces had worked throughout the 
night to clear the area of unruly elements and to restore 
stability. 
  General Turner said he also wished to clarify the position 
regarding the presence of Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner 
National Front] (AVF) forces inside Bophuthatswana. He said 
General Constand Viljoen had offered the assistance of 
Volksfront troops under the command of experienced leadership, 
to protect public buildings and strategic installations. The 
Bophuthatswana Security Council initially accepted this offer, 
with the strict qualification that the AVF forces be assembled 
at a specified gathering point, to be used only in this 
protective role, should the need arise. A force of about 1,000 
AVF men were duly assembled on Friday, under strict supervision, 
at a military air base about 20 kms outside Mmabatho. They 
proceeded directly to the base and were not involved in any of 
Friday's security force operations. At about 5PM on Friday, 
after consultation with General Viljoen, the AVF was requested 
by the Bophuthatswana authorities to depart and their convoy was 
escorted from Bophuthatswana under the guidance of the BDF. 
  General Turner said he wished to express his sincere 
sympathies to the families and relatives of all those who had 
been killed or injured during the unrest in Bophuthatswana in 
the past few days.
