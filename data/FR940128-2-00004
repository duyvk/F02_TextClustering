Scope of Order 
For purposes of this investigation, certain stainless steel wire rods (SSWR) are products which are hot-rolled or
hot-rolled annealed, and/or pickled rounds, squares, octagons, hexagons or other shapes, in coils. SSWR are made
of alloy steels containing, by weight, 1.2 percent or less of carbon and 10.5 percent or more of chromium, with or without
other elements. These products are only manufactured by hot-rolling, are normally sold in coiled form, and are of
solid cross-section. The majority of SSWR sold in the United States is round in cross-sectional shape, annealed,
and pickled. The most common size is 5.5 millimeters in diameter. 
The SSWR subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 7221.00.0005, 7221.00.0015,
7221.00.0020, 7221.00.0030, 7221.00.0040, 7221.00.0045, 7221.00.0060, 7221.00.0075, 7221.00.0080 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs
purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. 
Antidumping Duty Order 
In accordance with section 736 of the Act, the Department will direct Customs officers to assess, upon further advice
by the administering authority pursuant to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal to the amount by
which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all entries of certain stainless
steel wire rods from Brazil. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of certain stainless
steel wire rods from Brazil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or before August 5, 1993, the
date on which the Department published its preliminary determination notice in the 
Federal Register
 (58 FR 41726). On or after the date of publication of this notice in the 
Federal Register
, U.S. Custom officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties, the following
cash deposits for the subject merchandise:
