  [Text] A source close to the FAM/FPLM [Mozambique Armed 
Forces/Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique] 
representation in the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] confided to 
DOMINGO that "it does not make sense to try to dissociate the 
preelectoral campaign in South Africa from the ongoing events in 
Mozambique. Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] has been 
instructed to dismantle its units in the neighboring country. 
It is not too difficult to conclude that units of the political 
and military organization in South Africa and Kenya could be 
transferred from their training camps to Mozambique." 
  Last week, DOMINGO interviewed a senior government army 
officer in an attempt to confirm reports that some 5,000 Renamo 
men were being trained at a military base in Kenya. DOMINGO 
also asked the FAM/FPLM member to comment on the Renamo 
leadership's refusal to allow its withdrawal from the Salamanga 
state farm to be monitored. 
  [Unidentified FAM/FPLM officer] I have substantial and 
reliable information that confirms this: Renamo is training 
people in Kenya. Yet, I would like to stress that even in South 
Africa Renamo members in Phalaborwa and Sukuza could be crossing 
the Mozambican border. You should note, for instance, that from 
Salamanga to the border is about two hours on foot. That means 
Renamo units in South Africa can be moved in the dead of the 
night. 
  [DOMINGO] Do you confirm that? 
  [Officer] Like any other army, our intelligence services 
have 
confirmed it. Whoever wants to get the facts can do so. What 
we do not wish to accept is that Renamo should transfer its 
elements to Mozambique, regardless of their origin. After all, 
that is a violation of the General Peace Accord. 
  [DOMINGO] Pardon me, but the government has the details. Why 
has it not submitted them to the CCF, the body responsible for 
ensuring the end of hostilities? 
  [Officer] Look, very recently, General Ngonhamo burned 
himself with the story about Nampula, "Rex," and Nihia. It 
seems to me that there is a power struggle within Renamo. I am 
not concerned about that, but it could somehow influence the 
course of negotiations. You should note that Ngonhamo's 
appointment to the Joint Commission for the Formation of the 
Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [CCFADM] was a violation. It 
seems that the CCFADM is nonpartisan. So, I cannot see how Gen. 
Ngonhamo could have been appointed to the Supreme Command of a 
Mozambicann professional army. Moreover, this overlapping of 
tasks has been deferred by the Supervision and Control 
Commission! 
  [DOMINGO] What has that to do with Salamanga? 
  [Officer] It is very simple! But the answer is somewhat 
delicate! You should be aware that Ngonhamo belongs to the 
young generation of soldiers who fought FPLM. You should also 
note that I do not resent Renamo in any way. Yet, I would like 
to say that Renamo lacks cadres at all levels. Imagine what 
would have happened if Renamo had taken over Salamanga: What 
administrative apparatus would it have been able to put in place? 
  [DOMINGO] My question had to do with Salamanga alone, but 
what area in dispute?... 
  [Officer] Well, I have tried to explain all this philosophy 
-- the strategic and tactical aims behind the idea that 
Salamanga is an area of chronic and cyclical dispute. From what 
I have heard, Salamanga has nothing special in geophysical 
terms. What it has is military and strategic importance. Ask 
Renamo itself why it is so bent on staying in Salamanga. That 
means that only Renamo can explain its behavior. 
  [DOMINGO] But, as an FAM officer, what objectives do you 
think Renamo has in mind for Salamanga? 
  [Officer] I am no bureaucrat. I am a soldier and I deal with 
military operations. I see life in professional terms or, in 
other words, in terms of military strategy and tactics. I know 
that Renamo must withdraw from Salamanga. What I do not know is 
whether they will really settle in Chinhanguanine, an assembly 
area that was approved last year. In view of that, and not 
taking into account what I said earlier, I fail to see why they 
cannot move from Salamanga to Chinhanguanine. It is worth 
noting that those two areas are not even that far apart, so one 
cannot even mention transportation problems by way of excuse! 
  [DOMINGO] Does that mean that there are confidential 
reasons? 
  [Officer] I am not saying anything! I see things as they 
are. Renamo is afraid of what will happen in South Africa in 
the wake of the April elections, so it is trying to deactivate 
its forces in that neighboring country. It is a normal 
reaction. It does not know yet who is going to win, but a 
post-apartheid leader, from the African National Congress/South 
African Communist Party, for instance, will likely contest the 
presence of Renamo guerrillas in South Africa. 
  [DOMINGO] How? 
  [Officer] Just like this: Renamo needs Salamanga to house 
its 
forces currently in Sukuza and Phalaborwa. It is said that 
those training camps are now being used by Buthelezi's men in 
the Inkatha Freedom Party's armed wing. It is also said that 
the strongmen in Inkatha are Renamo people, or people who were 
trained by Renamo at the same time and in the same camps. The 
men involved in protection work, even in the Zulu "hostels" 
[preceding word in English] are Mozambicans connected with the 
Inkatha Freedom Party. 
  [DOMINGO] Are you not going a bit too far? 
  [Officer] I might have been, if we were not sure that 
Salamanga is just a farm owned by the state. Just imagine that 
the peace process grinds down to a halt here. What major 
offensive capabilities can you expect from Renamo assembly areas 
near the capital? What is more, Renamo rejected Salamanga as an 
area where the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] teams might be able 
to do dignified work. I can just imagine the headaches of 
Colonel Segala, of the CCF! [sentence as published] 
  [DOMINGO] And what about the government's headaches? 
  [Officer] It is true that the government has its own 
headaches, too. What I am going to say is an aside: We had to 
salute the Renamo guys in the military leadership course! From 
one day to the next, there was wholesale promotion of people to 
army officers! To give the course, they even needed an 
interpreter to translate the national languages into Portuguese! 
It is really too much! Yet, because of military discipline, we 
are forced to salute them left, right, and center! 
  [DOMINGO] So it should be on merit. 
  [Officer] That is how we would have liked it done. Look, now 
there are some diplomats who say that Lieutenant General Lagos 
does not have a conciliatory approach. Why? Is that not 
interference? For a start, it was Lagos who prevented Renamo 
dividing the country in the mid-1980's. Renamo's General 
Ngonhamo was Southern Region commander for several years. He 
worked with the late General Gomes. Naturally, you must know 
about the story of Nalazi and Changanine. Today, what matters 
is not what a certain officer did or was during the war. 
Rather, what matters is what that officer can mean to the 
national reconciliation effort. 
  [DOMINGO] Let us go back to the Salamanga issue: Why did we 
not come across a representative of the government, or of the 
government army? 
  [Officer] For a start, the Joint Administration Commission 
is 
in operation. There is only a short time to go before 
elections, and I fail to see the need for a new dispute. By 
that I mean that we -- on the government's side, obviously -- 
will be resettling there sooner or later. 
  [DOMINGO] What does Salamanga mean to you? 
  [Officer] It means nothing. It is a position, like any other 
position. Like Dunda, in Manica Province, or Savane, in Sofala 
Province, for example. It means absolutely nothing!
