THE BICYCLING embryologist took off his clips and declared: 'Potholes are
much more dangerous than genetic engineering.'
Lewis Wolpert, a professor of medical biology, blames Mary Shelley ('the
evil fairy godmother of science') for frightening people down to this day.
'The Frankenstein image touches something very deep in our psyche,' he said.
Monday sees the start of a 'European week for scientific culture,' a
programme of conferences, films, school visits, including a ballet based on
the Big Bang theory of the birth of the universe. The aim is to encourage
more career scientists, to stimulate popular participation in policy-making
and restore science to its place in European culture.
This is very much Prof Wolpert's theme, although he expresses it more
energetically and provocatively than does Directorate XII of the European
Commission, sponsor of next week's programme.
'Even the most intelligent of my friends worry about armies of human clones.
I say: where will they go to school? Where are all the mothers going to come
from? We know from the Hitler Youth that you don't have to go through
cloning to get people to think along the same lines. The fears are
grotesquely exaggerated.'
Wolpert, a Fellow of the Royal Society, is shortly to take over chairmanship
of the Committee for the Public Understanding of Science, a UK body founded
apparently on the premiss that public ignorance of science is creating fear,
and fear hostility.
This harks back to the famous Two Cultures jeremiad delivered by CP Snow in
1959. Was there still a problem, I asked?
'Snow was putting forward the idea that for most people true culture - in
the wonderful phrase of Max Perutz - is carried by the humanities while
scientists have merely been the plumbers of civilisation,' Wolpert replied.
Yet people were fascinated by science, he added. They were not so much
hostile as ambivalent, because science was so difficult, an unnatural way of
thinking (he has written a book on this theme*). Science lacked role models
and suffered from media stereotyping: practitioners were portrayed as
detached, boring people without spouses, children or passions. Anyway, he
concluded, press and television were run by arts graduates.
He thinks there has always been a gulf between scientific knowledge and
public understanding, probably even in Archimedes' day.
Perhaps, I suggested, mankind is not biologically adapted to contemplating
the cosmic or the atomic.
'I don't think it's even that. The real difficulty is that you can live your
life - I hate saying this - extremely comfortably without knowing any
science whatsoever. And most people do.
'You see science is a peculiar thing. But if you want to take your part as a
citizen, to take decisions about nuclear power and so forth, then you need
to know.'
Why do you think people still read horoscopes?
'People like a mystical idea of the world. They like magic. I don't have an
explanation for that. The New Age people love the discovery of quantum
mechanics and black holes. They take this hard-won hard science and they use
it for mysticism. 'Look', they say, 'we always told you the universe was
magical."
I said: you can't blame them if our ultimate knowledge turns out so bizarre
. . .'
'No, it's such hard, difficult mathematical stuff.' He sounded quite angry.
'Science doesn't make you feel better: it doesn't lead to an afterlife, it
doesn't give you any purpose in your life. It removes magical powers like
the ability to predict the future, read minds and so on. So you feel less
comfortable.'
You see such people as poor, lost children?
'Yes'. The professor grinned wolfishly as if he'd eaten a New Ager for
breakfast. 'I do. You're wicked.'
Do you want them to give up astrology?
'No. That would be an absurd view . . .'
But when I pressed him he eventually admitted that was what he wanted. 'I'd
rather they did the pools,' he said.
Prof Wolpert is by turns dogmatic and doubtful; he thrives on controversy,
loves to be provocative and is easily provoked in turn. His betes noires
include disparaging journalists (he named some) and 'relativist'
sociologists who regard scientific knowledge as no more than another human
invention. Philosophers were good, but irrelevant.
'I'd like to see myself as a liberal,' he said. I'm terribly permissive
really. On the other hand I love being politically incorrect.' He paused as
a doubt surfaced. 'Although I'm totally against PC, the fact that there is a
discussion about it has sensitized people to the way our society works. I
would have to recognise that the sensitivity is really quite positive.'
Wolpert works at University College and Middlesex School of Medicine in
London. He studies the mechanism by which the fertilised egg gives rise to
limbs and is best known for his account of how cells know what to do. (Like
mass flagwavers in a stadium display they get the same instruction sheet
telling them what to do in whatever position they occupy.)
He was born in Johannesburg, to a middle-class Lithuanian Jewish family,
swung to the Left but had no stomach for politics. He studied civil
engineering because he was good at maths.
'I couldn't stand it. They were so boring. No, I liked them. They were very
good friends. I loathed the course. All my friends in the arts were pretty
girls reading DH Lawrence and there was I in the beastly room doing
engineering drawings. Even on holidays I used to have to work in the sewers
of the municipality.'
He worked in South Africa, hitch-hiked north to Israel, and moved to London
where he converted to zoology at the age of 25, taking his BA and PhD
simultaneously at King's College. He has the Scientific Medal of the
Zoological Society and has been a member of the Medical Research Council.
Discussing the technical and moral limitations of genetic engineering,
Wolpert insisted that scientists have nothing more to say about ethical
dilemmas than any other citizen. It was for the scientists to advise, the
public to debate, and parliaments to legislate.
But as an out-and-out materialist (biologists tend to be), he looks forwards
to the day when science will enable us to isolate and treat criminal
tendencies, say, as readily as any disease.
'I can think of no situation in which knowledge would make things in
principle worse. Because knowledge is neutral. I feel very strongly about
that. This nonsense that science has some sort of value attached. Rubbish.'
The molecular biologist is interested in humans as organisations of cells.
Would he not always be regarded with suspicion by those who see the human
being as a whole?
'I dont think you're right. It's no longer regarded as murder to turn off a
life-support machine. Abortion is allowed. My materialist position has no
bearing on this whatsover.
As a person you have one construct of the world, as a scientist another?
'Absolutely.'
And the two things should not be confused?
'Absolutely. My responsibilities as a citizen have nothing to do with my
responsibilities as a scientist.'
It is a familiar argument. Yet this emphasis on detachment, on privileged
status for scientific inquiry may be what most worries the non-scientist.
Wolpert insists that scientific knowledge is superior knowledge. When you
say it is superior, what do you mean?
'It's the only way to understand the world.'
But you've just said that as a citizen you have to look at it in one way, as
a scientist in another.
'There is a big difference between understanding and making judgments.'
I thought of the non-sciences which lay claim to understanding: economics,
history, religion. Why should science be 'superior'?
'In the sense that there are no alternative explanations. And superior in
that it is also probably true and can be shown to be true - or false.'
Wolpert mentioned religion, and said he agreed with the sociologist Max
Weber that the secularisation of the western world owes more to capitalism
than to scientific knowledge. Although a hard-line materialist, he said, he
easily understood why religion was so attractive. (His brother-in-law, the
Australian Richard Neville of Oz trial fame in the Sixties had recently
given him The Tibetan Book of the Dead.)
'Many very distinguished scientists - living and dead - are deeply
religious. Now, for me, religion is not all that different from astrology.
But I wouldn't want people to give up their religion.'
Are you a non-believer because you are a biologist?
'I gave up religion long before I took up science.'
Science and religion are contradictory but plainly can co-exist in the same
mind, he said. 'I claim that is because one is natural and the other totally
unnatural.' (Science, of course, is the unnatural one).
Religion may be more important to people than science, then?
'No question. Because it tells them how to live their lives.'
Wolpert quotes Tolstoy, who said science is meaningless because it does not
answer the questions What Shall We Do? and How Shall We Be? He quotes
Einstein, who said that there was no conflict between the two because
'science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind'.
So to many people the knowledge they get from religion is superior?
'I agree with you. It doesn't mean to say that they're right.'
But science remains a privileged kind of knowledge?
'I couldn't agree more.'
Perhaps it's just this word 'superior' that you'll have to drop?
Wolpert grinned. 'I don't think I'm prepared to do that.'
The professor donned his red anorak, put on his clips and safety helmet and
wheeled his bicycle to the lift. As he whizzed gleefully away to Mayfair to
hear a lecture on gene therapy it seemed to me I had missed a dialectical
trick. It was not knowledge we had been arguing about here, but wisdom.
