The proposed Uruguay Round accord to strengthen worldwide protection of
intellectual property, virtually unchallenged since it was drafted two years
ago, has resurfaced as a focus of discontent.
In a belated and almost certainly doomed effort to change the terms of the
accord before the global trade talks are due to end on December 15,
representatives from groups as diverse as Guaymi Indians in Panama, Indian
farmers and Latin American drugs manufacturers have been trooping through
Geneva to air their grievances.
Last week the pharmaceutical industries of Canada, Egypt, India and 13 Latin
American countries issued a chilling warning on the consequences of
obligatory protection of pharmaceutical patents. This, they claim, will
reinforce monopoly rights of the leading drugs multinationals, raise
domestic drugs prices by as much as 1,000 per cent, increase the costs of
essential health care and put much of their indigenous pharmaceutical
industries out of business.
In the past, industries in these countries have been able to copy patent
medicines, often without paying royalties, which has enabled them to produce
drugs cheaply for home consumption and undercut patent-holders in export
markets.
The new rules would stop unauthorised copying by placing strict limits on
government powers to license production of a patented drug without the
patent holder's consent. This would be possible on payment of an 'adequate'
royalty only if a company refused to authorise use of the patent 'on
reasonable commercial terms and conditions'.
Gatt officials concede that industries in countries obliged to introduce
pharmaceutical patent protection for the first time will have their
long-term prospects dimmed. However, in the short term production of
existing drugs will not be affected. Nor will production of most new drugs
coming on the market in the next 10 years or so because they stem from
inventions already made and patented and now going through the lengthy
process of testing and authorisation.
A bid by Washington to secure 'pipeline' protection for pharmaceuticals,
which would have involved retroactive recognition of patents, was firmly
rejected by other nations. US negotiators, though not yet the US industry,
appear to have abandoned the struggle.
Gatt officials also point out that the alternative to a Gatt accord would
not be the status quo but increased bilateral pressure from the US, which
has already secured better terms for its pharmaceutical industry from
several developing countries under threat of trade reprisals.
'On the whole, governments think this agreement is as good as they will get
and they don't want to re-open it for fear of something worse,' says a
senior trade official.
The other main contentious and even more emotive issue - 'patents on life' -
is less easily disposed of. The draft accord specifically allows countries
to exclude animal and plant inventions (and bio-technological processes for
their production).
But many environmental and third world development groups argue that it
should outlaw patents on life-forms altogether on the grounds that it
sanctions 'bio-piracy' or the expropriation of poor-country resources by
rich-country drug multinationals.
Indian farmers have demonstrated in their hundreds of thousands against the
patenting of plant varieties, which they fear will threaten traditional
breeding of seed hybrids and the sale or exchange of seeds among farmers.
Though plants as such are excluded, the Gatt accord will require new plant
varieties to be protected by patents or other means.
Even more concern has been expressed over the patenting of human genetic
material, highlighted recently when a Canadian-based third world development
group uncovered a patent claim by the US secretary of commerce on a Guaymi
Indian cell line. The blood sample from which it was derived was taken from
a 26-year-old Guaymi Indian woman while she was being treated for leukaemia
in a Panama hospital. It is now held by the American Type Culture
Collection, in Rockville, Maryland, where it can be drawn on for genetic
research.
The Guaymi woman's cell line is of special interest to researchers because
some Guaymi people, the largest indigenous group in Panama, carry a unique
virus and its antibodies which may prove useful in Aids and leukaemia
research.
The draft Gatt intellectual property agreement contains some safeguards
against exploitation, but not much. Apart from the permitted exclusion from
patenting of plants and animals, it requires patented items to be the
product of an invention, not a discovery of something occurring naturally.
The Guaymi patent application did not deal with an invention 'but rather the
discovery of an antibody which is part of the blood of the Guaymi woman,' Mr
Isidro Acosta, president of the Guaymi General Congress, wrote to Mr Ron
Brown, US commerce secretary, last month.
However, such objections can be circumvented by quite minor modifications or
by the patenting of techniques to stabilise genetic material or extract it
from its source.
The Gatt accord provides for a review of the 'patents on life' provisions
four years after coming into force (probably some time in 1995). The battle
lines are already being drawn between Washington, which wants greater
international patent protection for life forms, and a growing body of
opinion keen to see better safeguards and fairer sharing between rich and
poor of the benefits of gene-related research.
