  [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] has issued a strong 
warning that the election campaign in the Western Cape could 
lead to an escalation of racial violence. Addressing a meeting 
in Wellington, DP candidate Hennie Bester proposed that parties 
take urgent steps to prevent the situation from getting out of 
hand. In another development the DP has dropped its plans to 
open an information office on the campus of the University of 
the Western Cape because the police are unable to give them 
protection. 
  [Begin DP Youth Wing Chairman Colin Douglas recording] We 
have no option but to cancel our events here. We are having an 
emergency meeting today to see what we can do about the 
situation, but right now it doesn't look like there's much 
prospect of a free election here. [end recording]
