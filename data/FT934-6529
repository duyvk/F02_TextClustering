The Steel Authority of India (Sail), the country's largest steel producer,
lifted net profit 18 per cent to Rs630m (Dollars 20m) for the six months to
the end of September due to increased sales and cost-cutting.
Sail's performance contrasts sharply with that of Tata Iron and Steel, the
country's second largest steelmaker, which recently reported a sharp fall in
profit.
Sail, a state-controlled enterprise in which the government has sold a 10.52
per cent stake to private shareholders, stands out as among the most
efficient of India's large state-owned industrial enterprises. Its managers
have taken advantages of the changes brought about by the liberalisation of
India's economy in the past two years, whereas Tata Steel's financial
performance has suffered from management upheavals and from the cost of a
large modernisation programme.
Sail's turnover in the period rose 12 per cent to Rs50.63bn. Production of
steel rose 6 per cent to 4m tonnes in the half-year.
Mr M. R. R. Nair, chairman, said the product mix had been changed to suit
market conditions. The improved performance came in spite of the stagnation
in the market, and was attributed by Mr Nair to 'all-round improvement in
productivity and reduction in costs. The energy consumption per tonne of
steel produced has been brought down significantly.'
Exports rose almost fourfold to Rs3.21bn.
