THE POLITICAL row between Italy and the European Commission over
restructuring west Europe's steel industry erupted into the open last night
when a meeting of European Union industry ministers broke up in acrimony and
disarray.
Mr Paolo Savona, Italy's minister, rejected a Commission compromise on
subsidies and capacity cuts at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker.
Senior commissioners and the Belgian presidency of the EU warned that the
impasse would be highly damaging not only for Europe's ailing industry, but
for the new Union itself.
Italian opposition to a 2m tonne capacity cut at Ilva now seems likely to be
discussed, at least informally, at the EU summit in Brussels on December 10.
Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, called it a 'black day' for the
EU, and Mr Melchior Wathelet, Belgium's industry minister, who chaired the
meeting, said the outcome did not bode well for the relationship between the
Union's institutions. Mr Wathelet said he would only call a follow-up
meeting of ministers, on December 17, if there was a chance of a deal.
The British industry, however, which has already cut jobs and capacity
severely, welcomed the fact that ministers had resisted agreeing other
restructuring plans which Britain believes insufficiently strict. The
Commission had asked ministers to give their political blessing to Ecu6.8bn
(Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies to six companies - in east Germany, Italy,
Spain and Portugal - in exchange for 5.5m tonnes of capacity cuts. Final
agreement on subsidies must be unanimous.
There was friction between Germany and Britain over UK opposition to a new
hot rolling mill at Ekostahl, east German steel producer, 60 per cent of
which is being offered for sale to Riva, a private Italian company.
The Treuhand, the privatisation agency handling the Ekostahl sale, will
today set a deadline of Tuesday for Riva to answer 'crucial questions' about
the new mill before the sale can be concluded.
British Steel welcomed the tough line taken by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK
minister, saying that by allowing subsidised new capacity at Ekostahl,
Brussels had not grasped the nettle.
Mr Sainsbury had told fellow ministers 'no agreement would be better than a
bad agreement' on subsidies. Denmark, Luxembourg and France are understood
to have some objections to the east German and Spanish plans.
