  [Text] Johannesburg March 27 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress [ANC] has strongly condemned the torching of ANC Deputy 
Secretary-General Jacob Zuma's Northern Natal house at the 
weekend, saying the attack underlined the need for the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC] and the government to act 
decisively to create free political activity in the province. 
Mr Zuma's house in Nxamalala, near Nkandla, was torched by 
unknown vandals on saturday soon after anti-ANC pamphlets were 
distributed in the area. 
  In its reaction on Sunday, the ANC charged the attack was 
the 
work of those consistently opposed to the peaceful transition 
towards democracy in South Africa. "The fact that anti-ANC 
pamphlets were distributed in the area prior to the attack -- 
and were the same malicious pamphlets distributed in kwaMashu, 
near Durban, before hostel dwellers attacked B-section last week 
-- indicates that the leaflets were aimed at creating a climate 
in which Mr Zuma's house would be torched," said ANC spokesman 
Ronnie Mamoepa. 
  "This latest attack underlines the urgency of the need of 
the 
TEC in conjunction with the government to act decisively to 
create a climate for free political activity in Natal and to 
ensure the success of the democratic process. 
  "We call on the law enforcement agencies to ensure the 
killers of our people in Natal and those responsible for the 
arson at Mr Zuma's house are brought to justice," Mr Mamoepa 
added.
