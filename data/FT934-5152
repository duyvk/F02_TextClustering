FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Clarke clearly has a bee in his bonnet about small businesses. There was
a welter of measures to help them including, after years of lobbying, the
possibility of interest charges on the late payment of bills. Equity capital
may also be raised through a replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme
and, in time, via venture capital investment trusts.
It will be interesting to see whether the Enterprise Investment Scheme is
any more successful than BES at attracting genuine risk capital. Even before
industrial companies were crowded out of the BES market by assured
tenancies, the thrust of the BES was to construct low risk ways to exploit
the tax advantage. The new EIS attempts to avoid that by lowering the entry
tax relief but reducing the cost of failure by granting tax losses. Yet
there are inherent difficulties with direct investment in this area, not
least the high failure rate which requires a well-analysed portfolio and the
provision of exit routes from those investments which do survive.
Even the new scheme is thus not suitable for most private investors, and may
not raise the desired cash for small businesses. Perhaps the best use for
the EIS will be in encouraging successful entrepreneurs to reinvest their
profits in a new venture and add their experience to the board. That gives
plenty of room for abuse, but the lack of management skills in small
companies is every bit as important as the dearth of equity finance.
