IRVINE APPROVES $1.75-MILLION FOR CHILD CARE

In what could be first-of-its-kind financing in the state for child care, the 
Irvine City Council on Tuesday night authorized a $1.75- million bond sale with 
the local school district to place child-care centers at schools. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to buy portable buildings to be placed at seven school 
sites for after-school care for 350 elementary school students. The agency 
formed by the city and school district already has built six day-care centers 
at schools for the care of 270 children. 
</P>
<P>
The loan will be guaranteed by the Irvine Co., which has issued a letter of 
credit to the Irvine Child Care Project, the joint powers authority formed by 
the city and Irvine Unified School District to develop the after-school 
day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
The project is empowered to raise money through the sale of bonds, just as the 
city or the school district is, said Deanna Manning, director of community 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The letter of credit means neither the city nor the school district is at 
financial risk for the bond sale, she said. "It's our collateral. So if we 
can't make the payments, the Irvine Co. will." She called the letter of credit 
for such a bond sale "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine City Council approved the bond sale without comment. The Irvine 
Unified School District Board of Trustees gave its nod to the loan last week. 
</P>
<P>
The joint powers authority now must approve the bond sale to "close the deal," 
Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Child Care Project was set up expressly to develop after-school care 
facilities at elementary schools. It received $250,000 in start-up money from 
the Irvine Co. and $20,000 from the city. The school district contributed the 
land and overhead, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The child-care project will not operate the centers but will issue licenses to 
child-care providers, who will pay rent for the facilities, she said. The rent 
will pay off the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The first six school day-care centers were started without bond money. The 
$270,000 in start-up grants financed five; the sixth was built by the Irvine 
Children's Fund, a nonprofit organization, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The next seven centers are expected to be ready for the school year beginning 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, considered a leader in child-care policies among local cities, appears 
to be unique in using the bond approach to finance day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hailey, children's services consultant to state Senate Office of Research, 
said it was the first time he had heard of a public agency issuing bonds for 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
Hailey called the solution well-suited to a growing city like Irvine. "This is 
not a way that a lot (of child-care centers) are going to be built, but for 
cities like Irvine, where there is growth and land, I hope those city 
governments and school districts take a look at this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Start-up costs to build or renovate child-care centers often are prohibitively 
expensive. One child-care consultant said constructing a building for 75 to 100 
children can easily cost $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
A 5-month-old child-care center on the new Irvine City Hall grounds -- believed 
to be the first of its kind in the state and one of the first in the nation -- 
was built with bond money, but the bonds were issued for construction of the 
entire City Hall complex, of which the $1.2-million Irvine Child Development 
Center was a part. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the Senate Health and 
Human Services Committee, is sponsoring a bill authorizing a $300-million bond 
issue to finance low-interest loans for the construction or expansion of 
child-care facilities, said an aide, Joyce Iseri. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is not alone in setting up day care at schools. In Pomona, the school 
district sponsors an extensive child-care program -- including 15 centers and 
programs for toddlers and preschoolers as well as schoolchildren -- and has 
been heralded as one of the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine was one of the first cities in the state to set up a child-care 
committee and hire a full-time child-care coordinator. The city council has 
adopted a policy which calls for child care to be available to every resident 
or worker who needs it by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said the Irvine Co. has given money to the cause because its 
developments bring dual-career families and single parents to the city. 
Children in those families have a pressing need for safe and adequate child 
care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While "latchkey" child care for schoolchildren is one of the city's most 
pressing needs, the city-school district venture is but one of many child-care 
programs promoted by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of ways to approach child care, and we decided we would use 
a multi-pronged approach," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has sponsored a child-care center operated by Irvine Valley College at 
Heritage Park and is working with a consortium of business interests in using 
the temporary City Hall building as a day-care center for employees' children 
after the facility is vacated. 
</P>
<P>
The city also sponsors school-age day care for children at five parks and works 
with private child-care providers to encourage development of new centers, 
Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue for additional day-care centers at the schools will not fill the 
entire gap for latchkey care "but this will push us a long way toward our 
goal," Manning said.
