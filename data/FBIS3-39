SUMMARY 
                              Damascus turned the unprecedented visit of an Israeli Arab 
delegation to Syria into a major media event, eliciting from the 
visitors strong rhetorical support for Syrian policies. 
President Hafiz al-Asad also used the event to restate Syria's 
overall position on the peace process.  The visit itself, and the 
fact that the delegation head was permitted to use Syrian media 
to portray a relatively positive image of the Israeli public and 
government, marks a significant, albeit limited, step in the very 
gradual thawing of Israeli-Syrian ties--a step that Damascus 
probably hopes will play well in Washington and Israel. 
                          END SUMMARY 
   Both Damascus and the 57-member delegation of Israeli Arabs 
professed that the delegation's 7-10 March visit was for the sole 
purpose of extending condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad on 
the death of his son Basil in January.  (For example, Jerusalem 
Qol Yisra'el, 18 February; Damascus radio, 7 March); nonetheless, 
the event was also viewed by both sides as having clear political 
significance.  For their part, Syria's tightly controlled media 
gave the visit far more extensive coverage than they did a visit 
of a large Druze delegation from the Golan Heights in September 
1992.  Reflecting the political nature of the visit, both 
President al-Asad and delegation head 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah- 
-leader of the Arab Democratic Party and Knesset deputy--spoke 
only briefly about the death of al-Asad's son, focusing instead 
almost entirely on the Arab-Israel peace process, in televised 
speeches (Damascus Television, 9 March). 
   A Show of Support for Syria 
   Syria orchestrated the visit as a show of support for its own 
policies, from the peace process, to the PLO, to Syrian Jews. 
Damascus elicited the visitors' vocal support via the Syrian 
media, which carried numerous statements by Darawshah extolling 
Syria and scoring Israeli policies.  For example: 
   -- According to Damascus radio, Darawshah called the destruction 
of Qunaytirah1--which the delegation visited on its second day in 
Syria--"a deplorable crime" and "praised the heroic struggle of 
the Syrian Armed Forces supported by the heroic Syrian people in 
defense of Arab territory" (8 March).  In his address to al-Asad, 
he asserted that "we share the same position with you" on the 
peace process. 
   -- Damascus radio quoted Darawshah as saying that the purpose of 
his delegation's visit with Syrian Jews was "to clarify some 
Israeli political and public opinion issues" and "prove to all 
who seek to distort the truth that Syria does not discriminate 
against the Musawi community" [community of the followers of 
Moses]. 
   -- In an interview with Damascus radio, Darawshah said the 
delegation had found that in Syria "everything is abundant, 
freedom is available, and loftiness and dignity characterize 
every action by Syria, led by President Hafiz al-Asad, may God 
preserve him" (9 March). 
   -- Delegation member and Knesset deputy Talib al-Sani' was even 
quoted as scoring Israel for trying to "penetrate the Arab world 
economically and to propagate the idea of a Middle East market" 
(Damascus radio, 10 March)--a recurrent theme in Syrian media in 
recent months (for example, a Tishrin editorial, as reported by 
Damascus radio on 8 February). 
   Even Syria's choice of personalities to greet the delegation on 
arrival at the airport was clearly meant as a statement: Khalid 
al-Fahum, head of a Syrian-backed umbrella group of Palestinian 
rejectionists opposed to the PLO, was the only figure reported to 
accompany the governor of Damascus to the airport (Damascus 
radio, 7 March).  The Syrians thus created the appearance of an 
affinity between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians supported by 
Damascus, while giving the PLO--still scorned by the Syrians 
because of the 13 September Israeli-PLO declaration of 
Principles--a symbolic jab. 
   1Qunaytirah was captured by Israel in 1967 and returned to Syria 
in ruins following the conclusion of a disengagement of forces 
agreement in 1974. 
   Al-Asad Uses Visit for Peace Message 
   While the visitors were used as channels for extolling Syrian 
policies, the visit also afforded Damascus an opportunity to send 
some signals on the peace process for foreign--particularly U.S. 
and Israeli--consumption.  Al-Asad used his meeting with the 
delegation as a platform for his first policy statement since the 
death of his son.  While breaking no new ground, al-Asad stressed 
Syria's commitment to peace, at times echoing his now famous 
"peace of the brave" speech to the 1992 Druze delegation 
(Damascus radio, 9 September 1992).  He told the Israeli Arabs: 
"We seriously seek peace, and the Israeli officials know this," 
adding, "In light of what they [Israel] are proposing, it seems 
that their vision of peace is not the same as ours.  Therefore, 
we will struggle until their peace becomes identical with our 
peace . . . . Peace means rights.  In other words, each party has 
its rights and each party is the master of itself and its 
interests . . . . When we said the peace of the brave, we meant 
that each party will achieve full peace with all its rights, and 
that neither party will humiliate the other." 
   A Limited Opening to Israel 
   The visit itself marked a symbolic though limited advance in 
Syrian willingness to take small steps toward opening contacts 
with Israel.  It follows such modest advances as an evidently 
officially sanctioned series of meetings outside the Middle East 
between Syrian and Israeli academics reported by Israeli and 
international media (for example, Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el, 31 
December 1993; Yedi'ot Aharonot, 2 January 1994), and the 1992 
visit by the Druze delegation, which crossed into Syria directly 
from the Golan Heights and--according to Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin--included some Israeli passport holders (Jerusalem 
Qol Yisra'el, 1 September 1992; Tel Aviv Bamahane, 23 September 
1992, respectively).  The fact that Darawshah and al-Sani' are 
not only Israeli citizens but also members of Knesset made the 
symbolism of the visit still more salient.  In addition, coverage 
of the visit for Israel radio by Israeli Arab correspondents who 
filed a series of live dispatches from Damascus was another 
unprecedented event. 
   Damascus took pains to prevent the visit from appearing as a 
precedent for normalization with Israel but nonetheless allowed 
the visit's symbolism to be clearly conveyed to the Syrian 
public.  On the one hand, delegation members were forced to 
travel to Syria via Cairo rather than directly from Israel and 
were barred from using Israeli passports (Cairo MENA, 7 March, 
Qol Yisra'el, 1O March).  In addition, Syrian media--and even 
the delegation members--avoided any explicit reference to the 
group's citizenship, referring to the visitors repeatedly as 
"1948 Palestinians."  On the other hand, the political status of 
the delegation members was made perfectly clear on Syrian media. 
For example, Darawshah was quoted by the official Syrian news 
service SANA as saying on arrival in Damascus:  "We represent the 
Palestinians in the Galilee, in the Negev, and other cities" (7 
March).   Moreover, Syrian media's airing of remarks by Darawshah 
even made it clear that he is a Knesset member.  For example, 
after calling in a Damascus television interview for Israeli 
withdrawal from all the occupied territories, Darawshah declared: 
"We say this from Damascus, and we also say the same thing in the 
Knesset in Jerusalem." 
   The visit also brought somewhat greater openness in Syrian 
media's treatment of Israel, as Darawshah was permitted to use 
Syrian television to convey an unusually detailed and relatively 
sympathetic portrayal of the Israeli government, the internal 
Israeli political situation, and Israeli public opinion.  After 
calling in his televised address for an Israeli commitment to 
withdraw from the occupied territories, Darawshah asserted that 
"of late, many people in Israel have begun to express stands 
supportive of this formula" and that their numbers are 
"increasing."  In his 1O March television interview, Darawshah 
depicted the government as interested in making further 
concessions but constrained by domestic political factors.  He 
noted that the current Israeli coalition government "is supported 
by the Arab parties" and that an expanded coalition "would enable 
the government to continue the peace process and to make 
concessions that will respond to the true Arab demands."  He also 
described what he said was "a rational trend" in Israel that is 
"strong indeed" and which believes that "we must end occupation." 
He observed that "the demonstrations staged by tens of thousands 
of people" in the wake of the Hebron massacre "was a joint 
demonstration by the Arab and Jewish pro-peace forces," adding 
that "we participated in it." 
   Although the Syrian television host openly took issue with some 
of Darawshah's remarks--such as the notion that there are doves 
in Israel--the visitor's overall message was evidently agreed on 
in advance, as suggested by the manner in which the interviewer 
appeared to pave the way for Darawshah's comments.  For example, 
he asked Darawshah, "What is new in Zionist thought and 
direction?" 
   Further Visits? 
   The delegation's visit has prompted reports in Israeli media that 
there will be future visits to Syria by other Israeli citizens, 
but there have been no such reports in Syrian media.  Evidently 
based on comments by an Israeli Arab journalist who was part of 
the delegation, Qol Yisra'el reported that Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' had told the group the delegation's visit "is an opening 
for additional visits to Syria by Israelis" (11 March).  Ool 
Yisra'el reported the same day that a delegation led by Ibrahim 
Nimr Husayn, chairman of Israel's National Committee of Arab 
Local Councils, and Ahmad al-Tibi, an Israeli citizen and adviser 
to PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat--"may soon leave for Syria."  Another 
Qol Yisra'el report claimed that a 170-member delegation of Golan 
Druze was being permitted by Israel to visit Damascus to extend 
condolences to al-Asad on his son's death, but that the Syrians 
had not yet approved the visit (15 March). 
   Implications 
   The very fact that Darawshah was given a forum for his more 
favorable statements on Israel suggests that Syria wants the 
visit to be seen as a significant indication of a genuine Syrian 
openness to peace with Israel and as meeting Israeli demands that 
such openness be conveyed more clearly to the Syrian public.  Now 
that the barrier to visits by Israeli Arabs has been lifted, 
there may well be more such visits.  But, considering Syrian 
sensitivity over even the appearance of normalizing relations 
with the Jewish state, and given Syria's repeated objections to 
Israeli demands for a commitment to such normalization in the 
future, similar visits by Jewish citizens of Israel are probably 
not imminent.
