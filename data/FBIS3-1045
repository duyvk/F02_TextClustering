  [Text] Reacting to the developments in the kwaZulu 
Legislative Assembly, State President F.W. de Klerk said he was 
worried about the volatile situation in the area, but that the 
government was prepared. He said he found Dr. Buthelezi's 
remarks upsetting. This report from Ronel van Zyl and cameraman 
Faan van Zyl. 
  [Begin recording] [Ronel Van Zyl] Speaking at a news 
conference in Randfontein, Mr. de Klerk rejected allegations 
that an uprising, similar to that which occurred in 
Bophuthatswana last week, was being planned for kwaZulu. 
  [De Klerk] We did not work together with the ANC [African 
National Congress] to topple ex-President Myngope. The de facto 
situation was that President Mangope lost control. We went in 
there to stabilize the situation. 
  [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk gave the assurance that contingency 
plans had already been drawn up in the event of problems arising. 
  [De Klerk] I am happy that we have basically in place what 
we 
think might be needed to keep the situation under control should 
something erupt there, but it is a potentially dangerous 
situation. 
  [Van Zyl] Meanwhile, Mr. de Klerk, as leader of the National 
Party [NP], paid an historic visit to South Africa's biggest 
black township, Soweto. Residents and street vendors of Dube 
and Kwezi were caught unawares by the NP convoy. Mr. de Klerk 
made two spontaneous stops to canvass votes. No vivas, no NP 
posters, but also no sign of intimidation. An inquisitive crowd 
gave Mr. de Klerk a friendly welcome. He was evidently pleased 
by his reception. 
  [De Klerk] A kind lady gave me this apple. That is the 
spirit that we need in South Africa. I've been overwhelmed with 
your friendship. 
  [Van Zyl] Mr. de Klerk said the NP would fare much better in 
black townships than generally expected. He said he was 
jubilant about the results of a recent telephone canvassing 
campaign. He wrapped up his Soweto visit with a private lunch 
for NP candidates. Other stops were a breakfast meeting with 
business people and a visit to the Rand Afrikaans University. 
Students gave him a huge cake for his 58th birthday tomorrow. 
Another stop was soft selling the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, 
where he offered this advice. 
  [De Klerk] Think deeply and carefully and look very intently 
at the economic policy of the various parties. 
  [Van Zyl] Showing his concern for smaller businessmen Mr. de 
Klerk stopped at a the local shoe shiner, a necessity on the 
long and dusty road to election day. [end recording]
