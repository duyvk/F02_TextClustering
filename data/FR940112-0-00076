SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 
I. Background 
States must provide Medicaid to categorical groups of individuals who are eligible to receive cash payments under
one of the existing cash assistance programs established under the Social Security Act (the Act). In addition, States
may provide Medicaid to the medically needy; that is, to those individuals who meet the categorical group requirements,
have sufficient income to meet basic living expenses and, thus, are ineligible for a cash assistance program but who
have insufficient income to pay for medical expenses. Sections 1902(a)(17) and 1903(f)(2) of the Act provide that,
for individuals applying as medically needy, certain incurred medical expenses must be deducted from income if income
exceeds the eligibility standard established by the State. The process is commonly referred to as "spenddown."
In the medically needy program, the spenddown process currently operates as follows: The State selects one or more
medically needy budget periods between 1 and 6 months and a medically needy income level, against which countable
income is measured. If countable income, after certain deductions are taken, is equal to or less than the income standard
(medically needy income level), the individual (or family) is eligible for Medicaid. If the income is higher than
this standard, the individual nevertheless may be eligible for Medicaid if, by deducting incurred medical expenses
(i.e., spending down the "excess" income), the income equals or falls below the standard.
Section 1902(f) of the Act contains a similar provision for deduction of incurred medical expenses from income. This
spenddown applies to categorically needy and medically needy aged, blind, and disabled individuals in States using
more restrictive eligibility criteria than those of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. These States
are known as section 1902(f) States. In those States, section 1902(f) of the Act requires that, in determining how
much income is to be counted when determining eligibility, the Medicaid agency must deduct from income: (1) any SSI
benefit received; and (2) any additional benefit paid by the State. If, after these deductions are taken, income is
equal to or less than the State established income standard, the individual is eligible for Medicaid. If income is
higher than the standard, the agency must deduct incurred medical expenses from the individual's countable income
to determine whether or not he or she is eligible.
States using section 1902(f) criteria may elect to have medically needy programs. Individuals who become eligible
for Medicaid by meeting the section 1902(f) spenddown are categorically needy unless the section 1902(f) State has
a medically needy program. In section 1902(f) States with medically needy programs, an individual who spends down
in order to meet the income test will be either medically needy or categorically needy. If he or she is an SSI or State
supplement recipient, or meets the income test for SSI or a State supplement, he or she will be categorically needy.
Otherwise, when the individual spends down, he or she will be medically needy. Once a section 1902(f) State elects
to use more restrictive standards than those which the State is otherwise obligated to use under title XIX for those
who will qualify as medically needy, its spenddown rules are governed by section 1902(f).
The statutory authority behind the general medically needy and section 1902(f) spenddowns is different. Under the
general medically needy spenddown in section 1902(a)(17), States must take into account, except to the extent prescribed
by the Secretary, the costs incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care recognized under State law.
Under section 1902(f), the spenddown language is broader. That is, the Secretary has not been granted the same authority
to impose a limit: States must deduct from an individual's countable income incurred expenses for medical care as
recognized under State law. However, section 1902(f) allows States to limit the deductible amount of expenses by
recognizing only the limited amount under State law.
All States are currently required by section 1902(a)(34) of the Act to provide Medicaid benefits 3 months prior to
the month in which an application is filed, subject to certain conditions. These conditions are that the individual
(a) received covered services under the State plan at any time during that 3-month period, and (b) would have been eligible
for Medicaid at the time services were received if he or she had applied.
