The 16-year-old housemate of Roberta Pearce, corroborating the testimony of a 
confessed teen-age murderer, tearfully testified Thursday in Vista Superior 
Court that Pearce wanted her estranged husband killed and told the two killers 
as they left her Valley Center home, "Be careful and don't get caught." 
</P>
<P>
Mandy Gardiser, who said she moved into Pearce's home about two weeks before 
the Jan. 31, 1989, killing of Robert (Wayne) Pearce in Cardiff, said the 
42-year-old former teacher's aide offered her "a line" of crystal 
methamphetamine after Isaac Hill and Robert Pilato left to kill her husband, 
and that she then helped clean the house of beer and wine containers that might 
bear fingerprints and other forensic evidence in case police came to search it. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Gardiser said, Pearce was angry that relatives called her to 
express their sympathy over Robert Pearce's killing. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd start crying and act real sad," Gardiser said. "When she'd get off the 
phone, she wouldn't be sad any more. She said, 'I wish these people would stop 
calling me,' because she had to put on a role." 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Pearce is charged with first-degree murder and could be sentenced to 
death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The day's most unexpected testimony came during Gardiser's cross-examination by 
defense attorney William Fletcher, who hammered away at the inconsistencies of 
Thursday's testimony with Gardiser's previous testimony about the sequence and 
timing of events. Fletcher unwittingly elicited a confession by Gardiser that, 
when she testified last year at the preliminary hearing, she was under the 
influence of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher and Gardiser were sparring over her specific recollections of 
conversations about the murder plan when, explaining the inconsistencies of her 
previous court testimony last year, Gardiser said, "I was on drugs at the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"During the preliminary hearing?" Fletcher asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you tell Mr. (Tim) Casserly (the deputy district attorney who is 
prosecuting the case) you were doing drugs?" Fletcher asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. "Yesterday (Wednesday)." 
</P>
<P>
"You were on drugs while under oath during the preliminary hearing?" Fletcher 
asked again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just really nervous," she said. "I thought it would help me not be 
upset. I just thought it would help me get through it." 
</P>
<P>
Gardiser also apparently contradicted herself again Thursday, saying once that 
her recollection of events was skewed when she was interviewed by detectives 
three days after the slaying because, "at that time I was doing a lot of 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
But, later in her testimony Thursday, she said she "was not on drugs" during 
her interview with detectives. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Gardiser, a key prosecution witness, admitting that she was under 
the influence of methamphetamine during her preliminary hearing testimony led 
to speculation among some defense attorneys Thursday that the defense would ask 
for a mistrial on the grounds that Pearce was ordered bound over for trial on 
murder charges based on incompetent testimony. 
</P>
<P>
But other attorneys said the issue would only go to the strength of Gardiser's 
credibility as a prosecution witness and not poison the prosecution's case 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a court-ordered gag rule, neither Fletcher nor Casserly would 
discuss the development. 
</P>
<P>
There were other inconsistencies with Gardiser's testimony and that of Hill, 
who already has testified and who, along with Pilato, has already pleaded 
guilty to Pearce's murder. Gardiser testified, for instance, that she never saw 
Pilato or Hill use drugs at Roberta Pearce's home, while Hill said he smoked 
marijuana and was injected with an unknown drug by Pearce herself minutes 
before he and Pilato left to kill her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gardiser consistently and vehemently denied that -- as the defense 
contends -- she spawned the plan to kill Robert Pearce without Roberta Pearce's 
knowledge so that she could continue to live in the Valley Center home that 
would otherwise be lost in the pending divorce.
