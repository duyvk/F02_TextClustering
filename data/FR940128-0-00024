(c) 
Policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.
 (1) In accordance with section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board's policy is that every annuitant has the
right to manage his or her own benefits. However, some annuitants due to mental or physical condition or due to their
youth may be unable to do so. If the Board determines that the interests of an annuitant would be better served if benefit
payments were certified to another person as representative payee, the Board will appoint a representative payee
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. The Board may appoint a representative payee even if the annuitant
is a legally competent individual. If the annuitant is a legally incompetent individual, the Board may appoint the
legal guardian or some other person as a representative payee.
(2) If payment is being made directly to an annuitant and a question arises concerning his or her ability to manage or
direct the management of benefit payments, the Board may, if the annuitant is 18 years old or older and has not been adjudged
legally incompetent, continue to pay the annuitant until the Board makes a determination about his or her ability
to manage or direct the management of benefit payments and the selection of a representative payee.
Sect.266.2
 Recognition by the Board of a person to act in behalf of another.
(a) Regardless of the receipt of written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with
the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor who is receiving or claiming benefits or to whom any right
or privilege is extended under the law, the Board may, in its discretion, validly recognize actions by and conduct
transactions with others acting on behalf of the individual found by the Board to be a minor or to be unable to manage
his or her affairs, if the Board finds such actions or transactions to be in the best interest of such individual.
(b) In the absence of a written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of
the person or estate of an incompetent or minor, the Board shall, except where special circumstances appear, recognize
a person to act on behalf of an individual under the following circumstances:
(1) When the individual has been adjudged mentally incompetent by a court having jurisdiction to do so;
(2) When the individual has been committed to a mental institution by a court having jurisdiction to do so;
(3) When the individual is an inmate of a mental institution;
(4) When the individual is less than 16 years of age; or
(5) When the individual is between 16 and 18 years of age and is in the care of another person and does not have the capacity
to act on his or her own behalf.
Sect.266.3
 Information considered in determining whether to make representative payments.
In determining whether to make representative payment, the Board may consider the following information:
(a) 
Evidence of legal guardianship.
 Evidence of the appointment of a legal guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate
of an incompetent or a minor shall be a certified copy of the court's determination.
