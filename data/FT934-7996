FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (5): Prize contributions to science
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARIANS draw on an illustrious tradition in computers. A
Hungarian-American, John von Neumann, virtually invented the computer with
his work on binary arithmetic. Per head, Hungarians have won more Nobel
prizes for scientific discovery than any other nation.
Even now, Hungarian schoolchildren regularly score better in comparative
tests than their western European counterparts. Hungary's inhabitants may
only number 10m but they like to think of their country as a 'maths
superpower'.
It appeared until the start of the 1990s as if computer ventures would lead
Hungary's trek to capitalism. Companies such as Novotrade, Kontrax, Controll
and Microsystem grew explosively to dominate the top ranks of the Hungarian
private sector.
But Hungarian technical genius alone has proved insufficient. Private
computer companies have fallen, or wobbled at least, like ninepins.
Novotrade has had to shrink to survive. Kontrax has restructured its
operations and rescheduled its debts to stave off dissolution. Controll was
less lucky: the company is in liquidation. And Peter Vadasz, chairman of
Microsystem, has left the company he founded under a cloud of losses and
liquidity problems.
Hungary's infant market has offered many opportunities for quick profit. But
the companies that have given in to
temptation have risked becoming jacks of all
trades and masters of none. The Kontrax group, at its most diffuse, owned
businesses in computer distribution, office equipment distribution,
telecommunications development, property, newspapers and finance.
So Graphisoft's success is an exception rather than the rule in Hungary's
computer sector. And even Graphisoft made an unprofitable detour into sales
of Apple computers before selling its distribution subsidiary last month to
refocus on software development.
