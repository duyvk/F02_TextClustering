  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  SUNDAY TIMES </H5>
  Economic Justice -- "In South African political mythology, 
economic justice is viewed as a matter of taking money from rich 
whites and giving it to poor blacks. This perception, crude as 
it is, underpins not only political rhetoric, but the policies 
and perceptions of the ANC [African National Congress]," an 
editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 27 March on 
page 28 notes. A second myth postulates "a massive shift of 
wealth in the past two decades from white to black," in effect 
"the policy which the ANC plans to pursue is already, to some 
decree, working." What has happened is a "massive shift of 
wealth from the poorest class of whites to the richest classes 
of balcks," in other words among "white and black, the rich are 
getting richer (or, among whites, at least hanging on ti their 
wealth)." "Unless the ANC adopts appropraite policies -- which 
means, simply, policies that will lift people out of poverty by 
placing them in stable employment -- we may subside towards the 
conditions of Zaire." "Class divisions, not racial dicisions, 
are likely to be the critical issues as rich blacks get richer 
and poor whites poorer."

  Natal Marchers -- "We know at least about 60,000 brave Zulus 
who believe that King Goodwill Zwelithini's idea of boycotting 
the April 27 elections and establishing a sovereign kingdom is 
not at all a bright idea," an editorial in the Johannesburg 
SUNDAY NATION in English on 27 March on page 6 notes. "We want 
to believe that the marchers are just the beginning of an even 
larger Zulu community" which "will use its might to show the 
world that it is not going to be a sacrificial lamb to save 
Buthelezi's selfish political ambition." "This is the time for 
all democrats to test their claimed popularity at the polls in a 
fair manner. Ths process should take place on April 27. 
Natal-kwaZulu should not be an exception to this rule." 
  De Klerk and the Generals -- "Open defiance of the state's 
political authority by police generals implicated in third force 
violence is worrying in the extreme," the second editorial in 
the SUNDAY NATION on 27 March notes. "While on one level it 
demonstrates the decree to which the police have become 
politicised, at another it reflects the extent to which they 
refuse to be held accountable for their actions." Weakness in 
the presidency and Law and Order Ministry derive from "the fact 
that over the years of NP [National Party] rule" the police 
"developed into an authority into itself, bent on protecting 
party political interests rather than society" and becasue 
"South Africa has no history of ministerial accountability." 
"Accountability must be forced on De Klerk, Kriel and their 
generals by the masses who have had to bear the pain of the 
government's distain for black human life." 
<H5>  BEELD </H5>
  Zulu King Raising Temperatures in Natal -- The Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans of 22 March points out in a page 14 
editorial: "King Goodwill Zwelithini has driven the political 
pressure in Natal higher with his announcement on Friday 
regarding the restoration of the Zulu kingdom -- not because he 
is fighting for the maintenance of the Zulu kingdom, but because 
he is holding out to his subjects the threat of protest against 
the election as a means of achieving his goal. There must be 
millions of Zulus in Natal who pledge loyalty to their king, but 
who want to vote and want the election to take place. Where 
will his call leave them? King Goodwill and his great advisor, 
Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, have the fullest right to fight for 
the preservation of the Zulu culture and traditions. But they 
have no right to deny other Natalians and Zulu subjects and the 
rest of South Africa the right to exercise their democratic 
right. The king, Mr. Buthelezi, and the rest of South Africa who 
are watching kwaZulu-Natal with bated breath, must know that 
the ANC will not accept the king's call for an election boycott 
lying down. Indeed, they are already making plans for mass 
action and other disruptive activities." "In kwaZulu-Natal the 
result will be much bloodier and messier that in Bophuthatswana, 
but the outcome will be the same," and "the party to benefit 
most will be the ANC." 
  Vote for All Prisoners A Mistake -- "The unrest in prisons 
in which prisoners demonstrated in support of participation in 
the election by all criminals behind bars can be seen as the 
fruits of an unfortunate compromise," says an editorial on page 
8 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 23 March. "What 
those who support the vote for criminals forget is that 
imprisonment is imposed with the aim of totally removing the 
offender from society for a period. During that time his rights 
as a member of society are withdrawn; it includes the right to 
participate in political activities. The argument being raised 
by the ANC, that it is unjust to prevent some prisoners from 
exercising their most basic right -- the vote -- does not hold 
water. The right to vote is not the most basic right; that 
right is the right to life, and it is that right which the 
majority of the criminals sentenced to death denied to others." 
"The granting of the vote to all imprisoned criminals merely 
compounds what is already an awful mistake." 
  Caution Needed Over Police Generals -- A second editorial on 
the same page notes: "We would Nike to believe that State 
President F.W. de Klerk, when he ordered three of the country's 
top generals to take compulsory leave following the release of 
the Goldstone report, did not act without very good reason. The 
allegations against the generals are very serious, but it is 
precisely for that reason that we have an uneasy feeling about 
the course of events during the investigation by Justice 
Goldstone." "A very important principle in law is that every 
person must be given the opportunity to fully state his side of 
the case, which was apparently not done here. In addition the 
generals were not provided with legal assistance and they were 
not given the opportunity to cross-examine the people who 
presented evidence against them. So we ask: go steady with wild 
accusations and allegations. Hold a full investigation in which 
the law is properly applied, before crucifying people." 
  Culture of Lawlessness Being Created -- A third editorial 
points out: "One of the most deplorable statements heard in the 
election campaign comes from Mr. George Biya, president of the 
Azanian Youth Organziation. Mr. Biya praised the looters who 
stole goods during the uprising in Bophuthatswana. His 
justification for this is: `No white man arrived from Europe 
with a refrigerator or a bed. On the contrary, our people only 
took what was theirs, and no apology is made.' Should one wish 
to sink to the same level as Mr. Biya, one could point out that 
it is precisely because of this kind of mentality by too many 
too often in Africa that the continent finds itself in the state 
it is." "Black entrepreneurs and the general public are daily 
victims of looting in its various forms, encouraged by people 
like Mr. Biya who are helping to create a culture of 
lawlessness. Real leaders will have to take note that South 
Africans of all colors are sick and tired of any form of 
hooliganism."
