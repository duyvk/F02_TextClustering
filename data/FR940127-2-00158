G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California ("G&K") (Registered Importer No. R-90-007)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1989 Peugeot 405 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United
States. The vehicle which G&K believes is substantially similar is the 1989 Peugeot 405 that PSA Peugeot Citroen/USTR
manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming to all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 1989 Peugeot 405 to its U.S.-certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
G&K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 1989 Peugeot
405, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its
U.S.-certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1989 Peugeot 405 is identical to the U.S-certified
1989 Peugeot 405 with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

the following standards, in the manner indicated:

 (a) Substitution of a lens marked "Brake" for a lens with an ECE symbol on the brake failure indicator lamp; (b) recalibration
