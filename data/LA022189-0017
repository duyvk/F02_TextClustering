PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS NOW CHALLENGED BY FEDERAL LAWS

<P>
Today the Supreme Court takes up a Massachusetts employment case that seems 
narrow in scope but is actually part of an important and growing legal battle 
that affects millions of people throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The clash involves the burgeoning number of worker protection initiatives being 
launched by state and local governments and state prosecutors -- such as 
statutes requiring companies to give workers advance notice of plant closings 
-- and the attempts of business, sometimes aided by the federal government, to 
halt those efforts by asserting that they are preempted by some federal law. 
</P>
<P>
"In virtually any kind of lawsuit that is filed on employment issues today 
there is some kind of preemption defense that can be raised," said Glenn 
Rothner, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents a number of unions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Case 
</P>
<P>
Rothner is involved in a major preemption case in which Southern California 
Edison has asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempts an 
employee's right to assert in state court that the company's drug-testing 
program violates the California Constitution's right-to-privacy provision. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Jackson, a San Francisco lawyer who represents corporations in labor 
matters, agreed that preemption cases have become increasingly important in 
recent years and are now at the cutting edge of employment-related litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The legal battles, ranging from a Los Angeles taxi franchise case to a Maine 
severance pay provision, are the outgrowth of some profound shifts in American 
life, particularly the diminished power of unions and the increased propensity 
of many state governments to regulate certain aspects of workplace life. 
</P>
<P>
The potential impact of many of these cases can be seen by the volume of 
friend-of-the-court briefs filed in them. Last year, 17 states, the AFL-CIO and 
other groups wrote briefs in support of Illinois in a case where a division of 
Magic Chef Inc. asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempted an 
Illinois law that prohibits employers from firing workers simply because they 
have filed workers' compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
The case being heard by the Supreme Court today involves a Boston banker, 
Richard Morash, who is challenging the constitutionality of a 1985 state law 
requiring any employer who discharges a worker in Massachusetts to pay all 
unpaid wages, including accrued vacation pay, to the employee on the day of the 
discharge. 
</P>
<P>
Morash contends that this rule should be overturned under the Constitution's 
supremacy clause because it conflicts with, and is preempted by, federal law, a 
contention Massachusetts vigorously disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Morash case will not be the last word on preemption law, according to legal 
scholars. However, if the Supreme Court upholds the Massachusetts law, it could 
create a more favorable atmosphere for states to enact similar regulations, 
said Clyde Summers, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, preemption issues have also been raised in many other cases in 
state and federal courts, including a number that ultimately reached the 
Supreme Court. The results of the cases have been mixed, but enough of them 
have been resolved in favor of pro-worker state regulations that union lawyers 
and strategists believe that new avenues have been opened to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Inroads' 
</P>
<P>
"States have been making tremendous inroads in employment law," said Jackson, 
the San Francisco attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for all the activity at the state level is a recognition of the fact 
that the vast majority of American workers are unorganized and in need of more 
legal protection, according to Summers, who has been studying the trend. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that workplace governance in the United States has not developed 
in the manner anticipated when the National Labor Relations Act, authored by 
Sen. Robert Wagner of New York, was enacted in 1935. The law gave formal 
protections to people participating in union organizing campaigns and put the 
government's stamp of approval on collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
"When we passed the Wagner Act . . . we created an image that we were going to 
regulate the labor market in this country through collective bargaining" rather 
than controlling it through a series of laws governing separate issues 
affecting workers, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 years ago, "it began to dawn on people that this had not come to 
pass," Summers said. "We had not achieved a (broad) system of collective 
bargaining; it was only a fraction of the labor market. As that awareness 
dawned, people began to ask themselves, 'What are we going to do about all the 
people who are not protected by collective bargaining that need to have 
protection from some other source?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Unhappy 
</P>
<P>
Initially, he said, the federal government began to fill some of those gaps 
through passage of laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the 
Employees Retirement and Income Security Act, the federal statute at issue in 
the Morash case. Then state and local governments began to get in on the act 
and management was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Companies, particularly national companies, are deeply concerned with having to 
comply with a welter of disparate regulations on the same subject, so they file 
preemption challenges, said R. Theodore Clark, a senior partner at 
Chicago-based Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &amp; Geraldson, the nation's largest 
labor law firm on management's side. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley labor law professor David Feller said the preemption conflict 
reflects the ironic convergence of two seemingly contradictory trends that have 
emerged in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is now a much larger constituency to provide legislation to protect 
individual workers," while there is a smaller constituency to strengthen the 
National Labor Relations Act, which offers workers collective protections, 
Feller said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of the decline of collective bargaining and the decline of 
unionism," said Feller, who once served as general counsel to the United 
Steelworkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan's appointment of conservatives to the federal 
bench and the National Labor Relations Board also prompted organized labor to 
look for relief in other venues, such as state courts and state legislatures, 
said Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco labor lawyer who writes a number of 
appellate court briefs for the AFL-CIO. "People are looking for alternatives to 
the NLRB," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This represents a marked change from the past, said Washington labor lawyer 
Michael Gottesman. Historically, organized labor viewed state courts as 
oppressive tribunals that issued picketing injunctions at the drop of a hat and 
state legislatures as enemy territory where conservative officeholders 
attempted to pass laws restricting organizer activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Laws 
</P>
<P>
For years after the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, the labor 
movement looked to federal laws as protections that were uniform throughout the 
country. In the past, it was predominantly unions that raised preemption 
challenges, trying to knock out state laws or administrative decisions it 
considered unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Reagan. The increasingly difficult climate for labor in Washington 
and at the bargaining table has prompted a fundamental re-examination of how 
labor can best achieve its goals, including the use of state courts, challenges 
to the all-encompassing primacy of federal labor laws and a willingness to 
support cases filed by individual employees seeking the establishment of 
minimum labor standards in certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
"These are tactical choices," Gottesman said. "In an ideal world, the country 
would be better with unified labor law," but he quickly added that the world is 
far from ideal and that the labor movement has to adapt to changed 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unrealistic to think (non-unionized) employees will sit idly by," 
waiting to get collective bargaining to give them greater protection. The 
movement to give these workers greater protections "will not go away," 
Gottesman said. "The labor movement's intelligentsia has been philosophically 
reluctant to openly advocate that, as a legal proposition, states have open 
season. But the pressures are irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
And such pressures create complications for labor, said David Silberman, the 
AFL-CIO's associate general counsel. "On the one hand, the notion that a state 
could enact a cap on wages or could fix wages certainly takes a lot away from 
the collective bargaining process," Silberman said. "On the other hand, there 
are all kinds of minimum labor standards that look desirable to us." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, organized labor has supported raising the minimum wage beyond the $3.35 
an hour the federal government set it at in 1981. There is no preemption issue 
on minimum wages and 11 states, including California, have a minimum above the 
$3.35 level. 
</P>
<P>
But while no one is raising the preemption issue regarding state minimum wage 
laws, many other state laws offering greater worker protection are being 
challenged on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toxic Chemicals 
</P>
<P>
One of the most heavily litigated issues are state laws directing employers to 
give workers and communities information about the toxic chemicals they are 
using. Although President Reagan espoused "states rights," his aides supported 
legal challenges by business groups to state "right-to-know" laws compelling 
disclosure of information about toxic chemicals that were stronger than those 
enacted subsequently by the federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, an agency whose political tilt shifted sharply after Reagan 
became President. 
</P>
<P>
A protracted court battle on the state disclosure laws has been something of a 
draw. In three separate cases in 1985 and 1986, a federal appeals court in 
Philadelphia ruled that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act 
preempted state "right-to-know" laws as they applied to employees. However, the 
court upheld the state laws as they apply to workplaces not covered by the 
federal OSHA standard or if the laws are designed to protect the public or the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
In several of the major cases, though, workers, unions and the states have 
emerged victorious. For example: 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the court unanimously upheld the Illinois statute on workers' 
compensation-related firings in the case of Jonna Lingle vs. Norge Division of 
Magic Chef Inc. This was considered a particularly important precedent because 
the fired worker, Lingle, was a union member whose contract had a provision 
saying that employees could only be discharged for "just cause." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the company's assertion that Lingle 
should be barred from filing a state court damages suit in which she could be 
awarded monetary damages because there was a remedy available to her in the 
collective bargaining agreement. The company contended that since an 
interpretation of the agreement was required, the matter came under the 
National Labor Relations Act and was therefore preempted. 
</P>
<P>
But Justice John Paul Stevens' opinion for the entire court said there was no 
need to interpret the collective bargaining agreement because the facts showed 
that the company had fired Lingle in clear violation of the Illinois law. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld a Maine law 
requiring employers to provide a one-time severance payment to employees not 
covered by an express contract providing for severance pay. The court held that 
Maine's law was not preempted by federal law. Maine's "establishment of a 
minimum labor standard does not impermissibly intrude upon the collective 
bargaining process," the majority opinion stated. 
</P>
<P>
But the states and their labor allies certainly have not won all the recent 
preemption cases. For example: 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1986, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ruled that a 
Wisconsin statute was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. That law 
prohibited a state agency from awarding a contract to a company that had 
frequently violated the National Labor Relations Act. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, in an 8-1 opinion, the high court ruled that the city of Los 
Angeles' denial of a taxi franchise to a company until it settled a strike 
"destroyed the balance of power designed by Congress" in the National Labor 
Relations Act "and frustrated Congress' decision to leave open the use of 
economic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are still situations in which union lawyers argue in favor of 
preemption. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the time now, they are arguing against preemption and in favor of 
greater state authority in the workplace. Just a few weeks ago, they were 
pleased by a highly awaited decision by the Illinois Supreme Court. In a 
unanimous opinion, the Illinois court ruled that the federal Occupational 
Safety and Health Act does not preempt local prosecutors from bringing their 
own criminal cases against employers who knowingly endanger workers on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended OSHA's penalties 
would be the only sanctions available for wrongful conduct which threatens or 
results in serious physical injury or death to workers," the court wrote. 
</P>
<P>
State criminal prosecutions of safety and health violations are considered 
important because in 18 years, the federal government has filed only 14 
criminal cases against OSHA violators. Although the decision is not binding on 
any state other than Illinois, and is likely to be appealed, it is the 
highest-level ruling on the issue to date and is considered likely to spur more 
criminal prosecutions of workplace safety violations. Local prosecutors from 
Boston, New York and Los Angeles, who have filed similar cases, wrote amicus 
briefs on behalf of Cook County prosecutors who had charged five executives of 
Chicago Magnet Wire Co. with aggravated battery and reckless conduct because of 
safety conditions at the company's Elk Grove, Ill., plant. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Chatten Brown, head of the occupational safety unit in the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office, praised the decision, saying that states and 
localities had "a deeply rooted interest" in protecting worker safety that 
should not be usurped.
