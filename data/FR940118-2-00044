<DOCTITLE>Division of Research Grants; Meetings</DOCTITLE>
Pursuant to Public Law 92-463, notice is hereby given of the meetings of the following study sections for February
through March 1994, and the individuals from whom summaries of meetings and rosters of committee members may be obtained.
These meetings will be open to the public for approximately one half hour at the beginning of the first session of the
first day of the meeting during the discussion of administrative details relating to study section business. Attendance
by the public will be limited to space available. These meetings will be closed thereafter in accordance with the provisions
set forth in secs. 552b(c)(4) and 552b(c)(6), title 5, U.S.C. and sec. 10(d) of Public Law 92-463, for the review,
discussion and evaluation of individual grant applications. These applications and the discussions could reveal
confidential trade secrets or commercial property such as patentable material, and personal information concerning
individuals associated with the applications, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy.
The Office of Committee Management, Division of Research Grants, Westwood Building, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, Maryland 20892, telephone 301-594-7265 will furnish summaries of the meetings and rosters
of committee members. Substantive program information may be obtained from each scientific review administrator,
whose telephone number is provided. Since it is necessary to schedule study section meetings months in advance, it
is suggested that anyone planning to attend a meeting contact the scientific review administrator to confirm the
exact date, time and location. All times are a.m. unless otherwise specified.
Individuals who plan to attend and need special assistance, such as sign language interpretation or other reasonable
accommodations, should contact the scientific review administrator at least two weeks in advance of the meeting.
