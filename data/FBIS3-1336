  [Text] King William's Town March 24 SAPA -- Tensions in 
Ciskei eased on Thursday [24 March] evening when representatives 
of the territory's defence force pledged total support for the 
Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. They also rejected claims 
that elements of the Ciskei Defence Force [CDF] wanted to 
restore former Ciskei ruler Brigadier Oupa Gqozo to power as 
"totally wrong and mischievous". 
  The TEC-appointed joint administrators of the territory 
formally assumed control of the Ciskei at 10 AM, and on Thursday 
evening President F.W. de Klerk signed a TEC-approved decree 
that gave them sweeping powers. 
  The administrators, Mr Piet Goosen and Rev Bongani Finca, 
said in a statement that all members of the former council of 
state had quit. They also called on all civil servants to act 
immediately to restore stability in the territory's 
administration. 
  Earlier there were fears of a showdown between the CDF and 
SA 
[South African] Defence Force [SADF] troops who have moved into 
the territory in armoured vehicles. It was reported that Ciskei 
troops took up defensive positions inside the territory's 
largest military base, one Ciskei battalion, when an SADF column 
approached, and that the column later withdrew. 
  SADF officer Colonel Johann Engelbrecht said on Thursday 
afternoon that the CDF was "out of control" and that its command 
structure had "gone for a total loop". He said the commander of 
the South African Force, Brigadier Toon Slabbert, had ordered 
Ciskei soldiers to hand in weapons they had seized from 
armouries. 
  "We are very gravely concerned about this.... There are 
literally hundreds of weapons floating around, shotguns, R4s, 
G3s." But in an exclusive interview with SAPA on Thursday 
night, ten representatives of the CDF ranging in rank from 
riflemen to senior officers, said they and their colleagues were 
non-partisan professionals and would serve the present 
administration and future government. 
  The represenatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
sent 
a delegation to the Ciskei's newly appointed admsinistrators on 
Thursday afternoon, and a follow-up meeting has been arranged 
for Friday morning. "We are loyal to the TEC and therefore we 
also support the newly-appointed administrators," one of the 
delegates said. 
  It was in fact the Ciskei military that had pressurised 
Brigadier Gqozo's government into joining the TEC. "I suppose 
journalists and some politicians would like to see a war. We're 
not going to give them that pleasure." At a press conference on 
Thursday evening, Mr Finca confirmed he and Mr Goosen met the 
CDF delegation. 
  "We were assured that all the rumours that suggested they 
were resisting the change taking place were false. They want 
the entire community of Ciskei to understand they are supportive 
of the transition," he said. A senior officer in the delegation 
said he had been in contact with the SADF, who had told him they 
did not want armed CDF members to continue patrolling outside 
the one battalion base. "We had no problem accepting that. The 
soldiers are back in the base, and weapons control systems are 
working." 
  He also said Brigadier Gqozo's resignation caught the entire 
CDF by surprise. Not even senior officers were given prior 
notification. There had initially been some dissatisfaction 
because it was felt that he had abdicated a responsibility for 
addressing lower ranks' pension and leave gratuity grievances. 
However, they were now satisfied that the joint administrators 
would address these issues. 
  Earlier in the day, the SADF moved into the territory in 
force to secure key points, including Military Intelligence 
headquarters and Radio Ciskei. A convoy of ratels [armored 
vehicles] also kept a watchful eye on the Bisho stadium, where 
ANC [African National Congress] regional officials addressed a 
few thousand civil servants and supporters. 
  Speaking at a press conference on Thursday evening, a member 
of the TEC task force on the civil service, Mr Zam Titus, said 
the decree signed by President de Klerk gave the administrators 
the authority to introduce laws in consultation with the 
president and the TEC. It also scrapped sections of Ciskei's 
constitution, and gave the administrators power to recover 
public property from former ministers and the head of state. 
  He said it had to be made "abundantly clear" to all civil 
servants that all existing laws, including those relating to the 
public service, were still in operation. "If they don't act in 
accordance with these laws, there are procedures which define 
what must happen with errant civil servants." 
  Mr Goosen said that as far as he was aware the territory's 
commissioner of police, Major-General Manyona Noqayi, had not 
resigned. General Noqayi, who was held hostage by striking 
police earlier this week, is to face fraud charges relating to 
faked salary payouts. 
  "The appointment of a new commissioner is one of the matters 
that will receive our attention at the soonest," Mr Goosen said. 
The administrators also had what Mr Finca described as 
"suprisingly positive" talks on Thursday afternoon with Ciskei 
ambulance service workers, who earlier blockaded the entrance to 
Ciskei's parliament and ministerial offices to demand pay parity 
with their South African counterparts. They also met 
representatives of the Ciskei police and nurses. 
  Rev Finca said a mechanism would be set up to deal with 
civil 
servants' greivances. An office for doing that would be in 
operation on Monday. Asked if the administrators would be using 
Brig Gqozo's former office, Mr Goosen replied: "Probably."
