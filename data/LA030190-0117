Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens called for the temporary relocation of 
Roman Catholic nuns whose convent at Auschwitz sparked a Polish-Jewish dispute.

Poland's Roman Catholic Church has begun construction of an interfaith prayer 
and dialogue center at the former Nazi death camp that will also contain a 
cloister for 16 Carmelite nuns. But Jewish leaders are unhappy with delays in

ended an official visit to Poland after signing an agreement restoring full 
diplomatic ties with Poland after a 23-year break.
