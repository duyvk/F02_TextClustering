  [Text] Johannesburg March 5 SAPA -- ANC [African National 
Congress] National Chairman Thabo Mbeki hailed the registration 
of the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] to participate in the April election as 
a step towards peace and stability. 
  Addressing the Socialist International Africa Committee in 
Johannesburg on Saturday, Mr Mbeki said the ANC had always 
strived for an inclusive political settlement so that the 
outcome of South Africa's first democratic election could be 
accepted as legitimate. "We salute leaders of these political 
formations for their sense of patriotism." 
  AVF Directorate Chairman Gen Constand Viljoen provisionally 
registered the Freedom Front to contest the elections. The IFP 
has also registered provisionally to contest the elections, 
provided their constitutional demands were settled by 
international mediation. 
  The ANC sincerely hopes the registration of these parties 
would indeed lead to their participation in the elections, he 
added. "The ANC was of the view that it was important that the 
negotiated resolution of the South African conflict should be an 
inclusive process, with the participation all political parties 
irrespective of size." 
  He said the multiparty negotiations had produced an interim 
constitution, which the majority of South Africans could claim 
as their own, which was important to achieve legitimacy and 
stability of the political settlement. "We have bee very 
concerned that the elections should be accepted by all South 
Africans, as a legitimate instrument to bring the country to a 
democratic settlement," Mr Mbeki said. 
  "The greatest danger to the holding of free and fair 
election 
is political violence. The parties which registered on Friday 
night had been saying openly, that not only would they boycott 
the elections, but would in fact disrupt the elections. The 
effect of their registration hopefully helps to address that 
matter to some degree, to the extent that they would then not 
disrupt the elections." 
  The ANC believes that amendments to the interim constitution 
addressed the concerns of the IFP, but the organisation would 
continue with further negotiations with the party, he added. 
"We are prepared to enter into an agreement which the ANC would 
consider to be binding on itself." 
  The ANC was also committed to further discussion with the 
Afrikaner rightwing around their demand for a "volkstaat" 
[homeland], provided their self-determination did not contradict 
the principle of non-racial democracy. "In the process of 
considering the issue of an Afrikaner volkstaat we have to be 
bound by principles of non-racialism and democracy." 
  Mr Mbeki thanked the Socialist International and its member 
parties for the supported they had given to the ANC and the 
struggle to overthrow apartheid.
