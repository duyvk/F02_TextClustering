West German steelmakers said production of hot-strip steel would fall by 15
per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with the same period last
year, because of continued depressed demand, the German steel association
said yesterday.
The reduction is higher than had been anticipated, reflecting dire market
conditions, a spokesman from the association said. The reduction in
hot-strip output for the whole year will amount to 12 per cent.
Steelmakers have complained that the failure of the European Commission to
reach a European-wide agreement on reducing over-capacity in steel markets
would lead to drastic consequences in the recession-hit industry.
