  [Text] Johannesburg March 10 SAPA -- A 12-year-old boy was 
killed and his mother and brother were critically injured when 
gunmen blasted their vehicle with AK-47 rifle fire on the East 
Rand on Thursday [10 March] night. Police said the mother had 
taken her sons to visit their father where he was being treated 
at a local hospital, and was returning home. The attack occured 
as she stopped the car at a traffic light in Alberton. 
  "As the car stopped...an unknown gunman or gunmen opened 
fire 
from behind the vehicle they were travelling in. The woman and 
her two sons were hit several times," police said. 
  A R150,000 [rand] reward has been offered for information 
leading to the arrest of the attacker or attackers. SAP [South 
African Police] ground patrols and a police helicopter combed 
the area until late Thursday in an attempt to track down the 
killers but were unsuccessful. 
  The names and addresses of the victims have not yet been 
released because their families have not yet been notified. The 
SAP statement said police believed other motorcars in the 
vicinity at the time of the attack might also have been hit by 
flying bullets. These motorists were asked to contact the East 
Rand Murder and Robbery Unit at 8452820.
