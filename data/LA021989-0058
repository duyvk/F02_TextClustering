Why venture down dangerous Himalayan rapids or up 40-story-high underground 
precipices? To stir up enough endorphins to foster a feeling of exhilaration, 
Tim Cahill explains, and to escape inner demons. Cahill's demon was the serial 
killer, which he studied for a book he wrote prior to taking some of the trips 
described in these pages: "Looking inside the mind of a murderer was 
terrifying. . . . In those bad, shaky times, when I realized that one more 
morbid detail, one more sordid fact, would send me screaming around the bend, I 
knew it was time to go out and risk my life for no very good reason." Unlike 
many Gonzo travel adventures, though, these stories are not so obsessed with 
walking on the "razored precipice separating rational behavior from irrational" 
that they lose sensitivity to other people, animals and places.

While Cahill mitigates armchair reader envy through bad puns ("We have always 
depended on the kindness of rangers") and bizarre quips ("In diving . . . you 
get to go around wearing tight rubber suits, and nobody thinks you're weird: 
this is our little secret"), a few of these adventures are better experienced 
than read about. Several pieces, however, are as substantial as they are 
absorbing. "Love and Death in Gorilla Country," for example, is an original, 
insightful look at an old story -- Dian Fossey's work with gorillas in Rwanda. 
Cahill is silly at times (he finds gorilla life to be "incredibly slow moving 
and predictable . . . like 'Dallas' on downers"), but he describes the apes 
vividly (they smell "skunky with a splash of vinegar") and he sensitively 
portrays the political power struggles that doomed Fossey.

An impressive collection, exploring the way the beauty and the darkness of the 
physical world is mirrored in the human psyche. Cahill seeks out stress, 
quoting author Ralph Keyes, "to enjoy the subsequent tranquility . . . . Risk 
is a part of therapy; you can put your life on the line in order to save your 
soul."
