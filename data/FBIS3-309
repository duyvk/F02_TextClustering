  [Text] Johannesburg March 3 SAPA -- Motivation to vote in 
the April elections is high, according to the results of a 
survey for Matla Trust published on Thursday [3 March]. The 
research initiatives survey of 8,004 respondents shows 83 per 
cent of black voters and 85 per cent of white voters intend 
casting ballots. However, only 50 per cent of coloureds and 55 
per cent of Indians intend voting. The survey shows six per 
cent of blacks, eight per cent of whites, 19 per cent of 
coloureds and 23 per cent of Indians intend abstaining. 
  Motivation to vote among blacks is highest in the Eastern 
and 
Western Cape (93 and 95 per cent) and lowest in Natal and the 
Eastern Transvaal (74 per cent). Among coloureds, it is lowest 
in the Western Cape (47 per cent) and in the North-West Region 
(46 per cent). Indian voters in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region are more motivated than those 
in Natal (62 and 54 per cent). 
  Women are less motivated than men in all regions except the 
Western Cape. The gender gap is between seven and 12 per cent, 
except in the Eastern Transvaal where 85 per cent of men and 62 
per cent of women will vote, and Natal where 80 per cent of men 
and 68 per cent of women will go to the polls. The gender gap 
is highest among Indians, at 29 per cent. 
  Principal reasons for not voting are confusion about 
political events, personal reasons (such as "too old", "against 
religion") and ignorance about elections and voting. Among 
blacks, lack of identity documents is the fifth most important 
reason for not voting. The survey also shows the secrecy of the 
ballot is either doubted or mistrusted by about 25 per cent of 
voters. Belief in ballot secrecy is highest among blacks, at 81 
per cent. The figure for whites is 77 per cent, for coloureds 
70 per cent and for Indians 74 per cent.
