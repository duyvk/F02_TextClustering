Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment group, yesterday said it had
dismissed one employee and disciplined another following the discovery of
improper sales practices.
Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said an internal investigation had shown
four examples of impropriety involving doctors who had been offered
inducements to prescribe the company's products.
'The most serious allegation was the one of bribery,' said Mr Scroggs. 'Two
doctors said they were offered money, while another said he was offered a
book token for nursing staff books. This is clearly not acceptable.'
The company had conducted an inquiry focused initially on the seven-strong
West Midlands sales force, but it had been extended throughout the UK
organisation, said Mr Scroggs.
'It's difficult to prove a negative, but we are as confident as we can be
that we have not had widespread bribery.'
Mr Rick Tiller, the West Midlands area sales manager who had been suspended,
had been reinstated. He was not implicated in offering financial inducements
to doctors, Mr Scroggs added.
Press reports earlier this month of excessive hospitality to doctors, were
unfounded, said Mr Scroggs. Any hospitality had been within the guidelines
set by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
Suggestions there had been a 'slush-fund' to entertain doctors were also
erroneous. Promotional funds were available for local meetings, but these
were not against the ABPI code.
