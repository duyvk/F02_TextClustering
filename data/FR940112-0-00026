&bull;Good Cause for Failure to Make Timely Reports 
Generally, in certain cases described in section 203 of the Act, a title II beneficiary who (1) Works for more than 45
hours during a month in noncovered employment outside the United States, (2) ceases to have a child in his or her care,
or (3) has earnings in excess of the annual exempt amount under the earnings test, is subject to a penalty (in the form
of benefit deductions) if he or she fails to report these facts to us within a specified time. However, under section
203(l) of the Act, a penalty does not apply if the individual can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that
he or she has good cause for failing to make a timely report. 
Section 10305(a) of OBRA 1989 amended section 203(l) to provide that the Secretary, in making determinations and
decisions of good cause, must take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including
any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has. 
Section 404.454 is the regulation which implements section 203(l). Accordingly, we are amending Sect.404.454(a)
to provide that in making determinations and decisions of good cause for failure to make timely reports, we will take
into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with
the English language) the individual has. In addition, we are adding a new paragraph, (a)(9), to Sect.404.454 to
illustrate that good cause may be found where failure to file a timely report was due, for example, to a failure on the
part of the individual to understand reporting responsibilities due to his or her physical, mental, educational,
or linguistic limitation(s). 
Under section 1631(e)(2) of the Act, an individual who is required under rules prescribed by the Secretary to make
a timely report of circumstances affecting eligibility for, or the amount of, title XVI benefits is subject to a penalty
(in the form of benefit deductions) if the individual fails to make the required report on time. However, the penalty
under section 1631(e)(2) does not apply if the individual is without fault or has good cause for not reporting timely.
Section 416.732 of our current regulations explains how we determine whether an individual has good cause for failure
to make a timely report for purposes of section 1631(e)(2). We are adding a new paragraph to Sect.416.732 to provide
that we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack
of facility with the English language) the individual has in making determinations and decisions of good cause for
failure to make timely reports.
