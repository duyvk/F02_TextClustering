LTV, the US steelmaker which emerged from bankruptcy protection this summer,
is to receive Dollars 375m from rival steel group USX in settlement of a
long-running lawsuit.
The money will be used to reduce LTV's massive pension fund deficit, which
has been put at over Dollars 2bn.
The payment follows allegations of anti-trust activities against Bessemer
and Lake Eerie Railroad, formerly a subsidiary of USX and now owned by
Transtar, in which USX holds 45 per cent. The railway company was charged
with monopolising the dock handling and inland transportation of iron ore
from Lake Eerie ports from the mid-1950s to the early 1908s, USX said.
USX said its potential liability had been as much as Dollars 500m, and that
it continued to appeal judgments of Dollars 210m made in favour of other
companies.
LTV's pension fund deficit has been put at Dollars 2.1bn by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, making it the third largest in the US, behind
General Motors and Bethlehem Steel. Assets in the fund before the Dollars
375m contribution announced yesterday were sufficient to cover only 38 per
cent of the company's pension liabilities.
The payment, which has been agreed in principle by both companies but has
yet to be finalised, will be made in two instalments, one later this month
and the other by the end of February.
