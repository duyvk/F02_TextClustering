  [Text] Johannesburg March 8 SAPA -- The Pan-Africanist 
Congress [PAC] has called for an inquiry to establish the cause 
of the train disaster near Pinetown in which at least 63 people 
were killed and 370 injured. 
  It said in a statement on Tuesday [8 March] that in the 
light 
of recent attacks on trains and railway facilities, "the 
concerns of our people must be addressed". The PAC expressed 
shock and grief at the disaster and extended its sympathy to the 
families of the bereaved. It also wished the injured a speedy 
recovery.
