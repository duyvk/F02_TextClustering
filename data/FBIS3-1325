  [Text] The Military Command of the Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] in Lunda Norte Province has urged 
the relevant South African authorities to withdraw without delay 
all South African Defense Force [SADF] soldiers whether they 
belong to the Buffalo Battalion or not. 
  The Military Command says if the South African Government 
does not immediately extradite the mercenaries fighting 
alongside People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FAPLA] units, it will be accused of destabilizing southern 
Africa because the presence of foreigners in the Lunda region is 
a violation of the spirit of Lusaka. The Military Command added 
that Pretoria, which has a diplomatic mission in Luanda, and 
South Africa, in its capacity as a sovereign state, cannot 
afford the luxury of saying it does not know what is going on. 
Members of the South African army have been deployed in Angola. 
Our source added that the South African mercenaries should 
appear before a court of law in their country for betraying 
South African laws, as stated by General Kotze. 
  The Military Command noted its disappointed, saying that 
mercenaries wounded in action in Soyo in 1993 were welcomed as 
heroes at Jan Smuts Airport. One should see concrete action 
before one can believe in Gen. Kotze. 
  Independent sources yesterday confirmed information given to 
the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel in early March by 
Army General Abilio Kamalata Numa. The information spoke of 
renewed military operations in northern Angola. The 
international media says in its offensive, Luanda earmarked more 
than 3,000 men and dozens of tanks, as well as heavy artillery 
pieces, but encountered strong UNITA resistance in 
Dange-ia-Menha near Cuanza Norte Province. The MPLA [Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola] suffered heavy losses. 
Katangese mercenaries were among the victims. 
  UNITA forces will not give up any area under its control 
until a general peace accord is signed in Lusaka.
