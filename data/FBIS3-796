  [Text] East London Mar 13 SAPA -- Gunmen burst into a 
church service in Mdantsane, Ciskei, on Sunday [13 March] and 
after separating the worshippers according to race, shot dead in 
cold blood the three they perceived to be white. Speaking in 
East London on Sunday night Ba'hai leaders expressed shock and 
dismay at the senseless killing of three members of their 
spiritual community. 
  The dead men are: Dr Shamam Bakhshandegi, 29, a dentist who 
worked at Mdantsane hospital; Mr Riaz Razavi, 44, the director 
of finance at the University of Fort Hare; and Mr Hooshmand 
"Alex" Anvari, a visiting American national. 
  A Ba'hai leader in the Eastern Cape, Mr Cyrus Mahmoudi, said 
the four gunmen had entered the church at about 2PM. "I don't 
know weapons very well," a shaken Mr Mahmoudi told SAPA, "but, 
according to some members of the congregation, at least one of 
the men had an AK-47, the others had pistols. There was no 
discussion at all. These men said they wanted the white people 
to stand one side." 
  The three the victims, who were picked out because they had 
a 
lighter skin colour than everyone else present, were then told 
to empty their pockets. After they had complied with the 
gunmens' request "they were brutally shot down in cold blood in 
the presence of many women and small children". 
  Mr Mahmoudi said that at no time had the gunmen given any 
reasons for their actions. "This was a blatantly racist attack 
against us, a church which has always preached that we are all 
one kind." 
  The killers then grabbed a set of car keys belonging to one 
of the men they had shot dead and made their getaway in the 
stolen car. 
  Another Ba'hai elder, Cecil Cook, of Stutterheim, said the 
"attack was on a religion which believes in the unity of 
mankind. Nothing could be more racist." 
  The Ciskei Government released a statement on Sunday night 
deploring the "despicable and cowardly action". The statement 
added that "every effort" would be made to apprehend the killers. 
  "The stage has now been reached when it is only fair to 
announce that no mercy will be shown to the sub-humans who 
perpetrate such crimes."
