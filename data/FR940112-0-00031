&bull;Amend Sect.Sect.404.988(c)(1) and 416.1488(c) to indicate that in determining whether a determination
or decision was obtained by fraud or similar fault for the purposes of reopening, we will take into account any physical,
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual
has. 
Good Cause for Refusal To Accept Rehabilitation Services 
Under sections 222(b) and 1615(c) of the Act and the implementing regulations at Sect.Sect.404.422 and 416.1328,
deductions may be imposed against title II benefits, or title XVI benefits may be suspended, if a disabled or blind
beneficiary refuses without good cause to accept certain rehabilitation services. If good cause can be established
for the refusal, benefits will not be affected. The final regulations amend the pertinent regulations relating to
good cause for refusal of rehabilitation services. 
The change we are making in part 416 of the regulations is based on the amendment to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act. We
are making a comparable change in part 404 in the interest of consistency. 
Sections 404.422 and 416.1715 of our regulations discuss how we determine whether an individual has good cause for
refusing rehabilitation services. We are amending Sect.Sect.404.422(e) and 416.1715(a) to provide that in making
good cause determinations concerning the refusal of rehabilitation services, we will take into account any physical,
mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual
has. We are also making a technical correction in a cross-reference contained in Sect.416.2203 to indicate that
"good cause" for refusal of vocational rehabilitation services is defined in Sect.416.1715. 
Good Reason for Not Applying for Other Benefits 
Section 1611(e)(2) of the Act requires that SSI applicants and beneficiaries apply for other benefits for which they
may be eligible within 30 days from the date the individual receives our notice about any other benefits for which the
individual is likely to be eligible. Our existing regulations Sect.Sect.416.210(e) and 416.1330(a) provide
that individuals are not eligible for SSI benefits if they do not apply for the other benefits when told to do so. However,
both Sect.Sect.416.210(e) and 416.1330(a) provide that the individual will not be found ineligible for SSI benefits
if the individual had good reason (Sect.416.210(e)) or good cause (Sect.416.1330(a)) for not applying for the
other benefits within the 30-day period or taking other necessary steps to obtain them. 
We are amending Sect.416.210(e)(2) to provide that we will take into account any physical, mental, educational,
or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has in determining
good reason or good cause for not filing for other benefits. Since Sect.416.1330(a) refers to Sect.416.210(e),
we are not amending Sect.416.1330(a).
