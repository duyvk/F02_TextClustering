A presidential commission planning the 500th anniversary celebration of 
Columbus' voyage to America has been plagued by problems: a tiny budget, few 
corporate donations and, until this month, almost no publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Now add a conflict-of-interest controversy to its list of woes. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's chairman, Miami real estate developer John Goudie, resigned amid 
disclosures that a close friend has ties to a company doing business with the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
The event's biggest corporate sponsor, Texaco Inc., suspended its donations in 
September after raising questions about the commission's management. Another 
potential sponsor, Chrysler Corp., may stay away from the event. 
</P>
<P>
And a congressional subcommittee is looking into Goudie's involvement with the 
Christopher Columbus Licensing Group Inc., or CCLG, of Miami and New York. 
</P>
<P>
"To have this project blow up in our faces now is making it difficult to deal 
with future sponsors," said Frederick Guardabassi, a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 
businessman who has served on the commission since 1985. "So much damage has 
been done to the commission. It's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpieces of the celebration are replicas of Columbus' three ships being 
built in Spain and originally financed with money from Texaco. The commission 
is $600,000 in arrears in payments for the ships, which are to follow Columbus' 
route and visit 50 U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler says it wants to clear up unspecified contractual questions before 
making a donation of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has appropriated $210,000 a year for the commission, which pays for 
staff salaries and office space. 
</P>
<P>
Strapped for cash, the commission turned to CCLG in 1989 because the company 
was willing to pay $300,000 immediately for the licensing rights to Columbus 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
The rights potentially are worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
Goudie is a popular fund-raiser for Republican candidates in Florida. His 
Hispanic background made him a natural for the commission chairmanship, say GOP 
figures in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
This year, CCLG paid at least $35,000 to Manuel Gonzalez, who describes Goudie 
as a close friend. The two Miami businessmen have known each other since their 
days in junior college, Gonzalez said during the course of several interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Other commissioners said they didn't know about Gonzalez' role. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned," said Commissioner Charles Ginoli, who served on the finance 
committee that reviewed the CCLG contract.
