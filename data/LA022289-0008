Fielding's column was interesting and had some excellent suggestions but it 
certainly did not focus on the cause of downtown congestion -- too many people 
driving into the downtown area. The reason more and more people are coming 
downtown is plain enough to see if you come downtown -- high-rise office 
buildings of 40-plus stories. It is these hives that attract the bees. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the more hives you build the more bees you will attract and 
the more congestion you will have. Does this mean that our mayor and the 
developers want more congestion or don't see the connection between beehives 
and bees? Of course not. They know. But they have a plan to relieve future 
gridlock -- the subway at $259 million a mile.

<P>
Will the subway relieve congestion? It hasn't in San Francisco, Miami or any 
other city where it has been tried. They are all multibillion-dollar white 
elephants that have to be subsidized by the taxpayer. But the Los Angeles Metro 
Rail will be different say its sponsors. It will be as successful as New York 
City's subway. At the rate we are building high-rises downtown that may well 
prove true. I can hardly wait.
