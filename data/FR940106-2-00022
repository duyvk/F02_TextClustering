 Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:
 In response to a request from the petitioner, Flowline Division of Markovitz Enterprises, Inc. (Flowline), the Department
of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain stainless
steel butt-weld pipe and tube fittings (SSPFs) from Japan. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter, Benkan
Corporation (Benkan), and exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period from March 1,
1992, through February 28, 1993. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins for the period. 
As a result of the review, the Department has preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference
between the United States price (USP) and foreign market value (FMV). Interested parties are invited to comment on
these preliminary results.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 
Background 
On March 12, 1993, the Department published a notice of "Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review" (58 FR
13583) of the antidumping duty order on SSPFs from Japan (53 FR 9787). On March 29, 1993, Flowline requested an administrative
review. The Department initiated the review on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26960), covering the period March 1, 1992, through
February 28, 1993. The Department has now conducted this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of
1930, as amended (the Act). 
Scope of the Review 
The products covered by this review include certain stainless steel butt-weld pipe and tube fittings. These fittings
are used in piping systems for chemical plants, pharmaceutical plants, food processing facilities, waste treatment
facilities, semiconductor equipment applications, nuclear power plants, and other areas. 
This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 7307.23.0000.
The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written product description remains dispositive.
This review covers sales and entries by Benkan of the subject 
merchandise during the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. 
Such or Similar Comparisons 
For Benkan, pursuant to section 771(16) of the Act, the Department established the following criteria for matching
sales in the home and U.S. markets: Type of fitting, seam condition, steel material grade, unit product weight within
10 percent, nominal pipe size, and wall thickness. An identical pipe is one that matches all of these criteria. A similar
pipe is one that has one or more differences in these discrete criteria from the U.S. fitting other than the type of fitting,
seam condition, and unit product weight within 10 percent. The 10 percent variance in unit product weight reflects
our prior practice in this case which was based upon allowable deviations between Japanese and U.S. industry standards.
The Department established this hierarchy of criteria after soliciting comments from Flowline and Benkan at the
beginning of the 1992-1993 review period. Both Flowline and Benkan agreed on the criteria and their hierarchy.
United States Price 
In calculating USP, the Department used purchase price, as defined in section 772(b) of the Act, because the merchandise
was sold to an unrelated purchaser in the United States prior to its importation and exporter's sales price was not
indicated by other circumstances. The Department based USP on the packed, delivered price to those unrelated purchasers.
The Department has determined that the date of sale for this merchandise is the invoice date because the invoice always
sets forth agreed prices and quantities and represents the first transactional document which systematically records
agreed prices. The Department made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, U.S. inland freight,
U.S. duties, U.S. brokerage fees, ocean freight, marine insurance, foreign brokerage fees, and discounts. 
On October 7, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), in 
Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company 
v. 
United States,
 Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise
at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to the foreign market sales.

Slip Op. 93-194 at 12.
