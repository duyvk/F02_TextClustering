MR Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, today will try to cajole the
European Union's industry and competition commissioners into agreeing plans
for the future of Ekostahl, the east German steelmaker.
The Treuhand privatisation agency wants Riva, the private Italian
steelmaker, to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the construction
of a hot-rolling mill.
But Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, is understood to be
insisting on further cuts in capacity at Ekostahl to offset the addition of
the new mill.
Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, who is in charge of industry policy,
are keen to limit state subsidies to publicly owned steelmakers and to cut
capacity to relieve pressure on the industry throughout the member states.
They will meet Mr Rexrodt in Brussels today to discuss their difficulties
with the Ekostahl case.
A spokesman for Mr Van Miert said yesterday that the full Commission would
consider both the Ekostahl case and the Italian authorities' plans for
restructuring of Ilva, the loss-making state steel producer, at their
meeting today.
But it is almost certain there will not be enough time to prepare for a
formal decision on the controversial subsidy cases at the meeting of EU
industry ministers on Thursday next week.
Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, added to the confusion
yesterday when he threatened to press ahead with restructuring of Ilva if
the Commission was not more flexible. Mr Savona told the Italian parliament
the government would complain to the European Court of Justice if the EU did
not make concessions on capacity cuts.
