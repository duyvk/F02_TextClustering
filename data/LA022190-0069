A fire burning for more than a week in a tire dump the size of 18 football 
fields is threatening to become a major environmental disaster here in southern 
Ontario province, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
If just half of the estimated 14 million tires in the dump were to liquefy in 
the fire's intense heat, one Canadian expert on tire recycling has said, they 
could produce more oil than last year's notorious Exxon Valdez oil spill in 
Alaska. And such oil, containing toxic chemicals, would be even harder to clean 
up than the Exxon Valdez disaster, warned the expert, Brian Latto, a mechanical 
engineering professor at the University of Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the oil) goes down into the soil, you can't clean it, whereas on the sea, 
at least you can clean it with detergents," Latto said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they believe an arsonist started the fire. Hundreds of area 
residents had to be evacuated last week as the top layers of the tires burned 
and huge clouds of black smoke billowed into the sky. Now, however, the top 
layer has melted into a lava-like ooze covering the burning tires below, 
creating a structure resembling an oven. 
</P>
<P>
Less black smoke is evident now, and some of the residents have ventured home. 
But the fire is still burning, and Latto said there is enough oxygen beneath 
the pile's surface to fuel the blaze for weeks or months. In the United States, 
tire fires have burned for six months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
"The tires are a beautiful rabbit warren for air to get in, like wood in a 
grate," he said, adding that temperatures inside the pile could be as high as 
4,532 degrees Fahrenheit -- hotter than the melting point of steel. 
</P>
<P>
Extreme heat turns rubber into oil, and a single tire can generate about two 
gallons of oil as it liquefies. Thus, if half the pile at Hagersville were to 
melt, about 14 million gallons of toxic oil could seep into the farmland and 
ground water nearby. The Exxon Valdez leaked about 11 million gallons of oil 
into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Latto noted that this is a worst-case calculation and that the Hagersville fire 
could ultimately send much less oil into the ground water, depending on wind, 
soil conditions and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the oil from the burning tires contains cancer-causing benzene and 
toluene, along with other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters in the region have expressed concern that the water they have been 
using to fight the blaze is actually helping to leach the oil and chemicals 
into the ground. Last weekend, they stopped spraying water on the fire and dug 
ditches for the dirty water to run into. 
</P>
<P>
Then they wrestled huge hoses into place at the ends of the ditches and went to 
work trying to skim the oil off the water and pump it into tanker trucks. They 
said they hoped to reuse the dirty water to extinguish the flames, but they 
added that some of the contaminated liquid will inevitably seep into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said ground water in the Hagersville area flows toward Lake Erie at 
about 500 yards per year. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at Edward Straza's Tyre King Tyre Recycling Ltd., where 
neighbors said Straza made a living receiving unwanted tires from service 
stations, charging garage owners 50 cents to $1 apiece to dump the unwanted 
tires on his land. They said he had a sharp eye for picking still-usable tires 
out and reselling them. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the tires just sat on his land, heaped in piles at least 30 feet 
tall. Straza even had tires in his front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Such sites are fairly common in industrialized countries, Latto said. 
</P>
<P>
After a small fire at the dump site several years ago, Ontario officials had 
ordered Straza to fence off the tires, to arrange them in separate heaps so 
that firetrucks could drive among them if necessary and to build a 
100,000-gallon water reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
However, Straza had argued that the cost of reorganizing the tires in separate 
piles and digging a reservoir would put him out of business. He appealed the 
order, the tires stayed put and the authorities had not yet ruled on the appeal 
when the current blaze broke out.
