Speed bumps, or sleeping policemen, can cause a nasty jolt to anyone driving
too fast. That is their purpose, but even those going at the correct speed
can sometimes receive an uncomfortable shock.
Inventions, a UK company, has developed a new system in which the car's
speed is evaluated by a mechanical trigger mechanism, with the ramp only
snapping up if the vehicle is going too fast. If the speed limit is adhered
to, the ramps stay flat.
Britain's Department of Transport is now looking at the system, designed to
meet the objections of those operating emergency vehicles - such as
ambulances - to conventional speed bumps.
