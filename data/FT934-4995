GERMANY'S Daimler-Benz and Japan's Mitsubishi, two of the world's largest
industrial groups, yesterday agreed to a package of measures aimed at
marketing each other's goods and increasing co-operation in recycling.
The agreements were unveiled last night in Berlin following 3 1/2 years of
discussions and several co-operation agreements.
Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, said: 'This kind of co-operation
between two huge industrial groups is still considered unique.'
Mr Shinroku Morohashi, the chairman of Mitsubishi, said that despite the
differences in management philosophy and corporate culture, relations
between the two companies 'would deepen'.
The projects are aimed at consolidating Daimler-Benz's strategy of gaining a
foothold in Japan and south-east Asia. They are also designed to strengthen
the competitiveness of Mitsubishi.
Projects range from environmental and recycling licence agreements and joint
ventures to distribution and marketing of Daimler-Benz products. They
include:
Metallurgical recycling process. A joint venture between Mercedes Benz and
Austrian Industries will take responsibility for technology transfer and
development, while Mitsubishi will market the process in Japan and
throughout the Asian market. The process replaces the conventional method of
shredding used cars.
Car industry. A subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz will assemble, distribute and
market the Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck in South Africa.
Electronics. Mitsubishi Electric will supply Temic Telefunken
microelectronic, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, with technology required for
the manufacture of semi-conductors for cars.
Plastics. Both companies will conduct a one-year feasibility study on the
recycling of waste plastics, with emphasis on cars, aircraft and electric
appliances.
A Daimler-Benz official said yesterday's agreements were expected to be
enhanced.
