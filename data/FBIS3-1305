  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>
  `Selective Morality' of Foreign Community -- "There has been 
a strange silence from church leaders over the execution of two 
Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement, AWB] members 
who, no matter that their organisation is neo-Fascist, were 
still human beings who did not deserve to be killed in Mmabatho 
in this horrendous fashion," declares the page-6 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 22 March. "We have heard 
no word from the dozens of foreign peace observers and monitors 
about the shocking events in Bophuthatswana or from their 
governments for that matter." THE CITIZEN believes that if 
kwaZulu Chief Minister Buthelezi "doesn't give the undertakings 
sought and is Bophuthatswana-ed, the observers and monitors will 
remain silent and the OAU and other foreign groupings will say 
`Serves him right,' no matter how many people are killed. It 
does suggest a kind of selective morality, but then we have 
always accused the foreign community of being biased -- and this 
election will not make them take a more objective view." THE 
CITIZEN also urges the African National Congress (ANC) not to 
"drive matters to extremes as happened in Bophuthatswana. The 
Zulus who support Chief Buthelezi are of warrior stock and they 
will not easily succumb -- as they have shown up till now -- to 
imported violence." 
<H6>  THE STAR </H6>
  Pressure on Buthelezi To Participate in Election -- As a 
result of the ousting of Lucas Mangope in Bophuthatswana and the 
resignation of Oupa Gqozo in Ciskei, "the pressure on Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi is now bound to increase," notes a page-20 editorial 
in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 March. "The Freedom 
Alliance which may have bolstered his Ulundi laager is virtually 
defunct. There are signs of disunity in the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party], and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] is not 
going to allow kwaZulu to become a no-go area in the election." 
"The kwaZulu Chief Minister must know that his anti-election 
platform and machinations around a Zulu kingdom are profoundly 
misguided tactics. And his chances of emerging from the 
transition phase with honour are rapidly diminishing." 
Buthelezi is encouraged to "participate in the election before 
events overtake him." 
  Prisoners' Vote `Blackmail' -- A second editorial on the 
same 
page notes that the TEC has reversed its decision to exclude 
certain prisoners from voting in the forthcoming election and 
says this "has set a disturbing precedent for the manner in 
which this country will be governed." The impression left by 
the TEC is that "if people cause sufficient mayhem, those in 
authority will rather not make a stand. Apologists claim that 
the country is in transition; that this is our first 
all-inclusive election and so on, but they miss the point. 
Giving in to blackmail merely evades problems; it never settles 
them." 
<H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>
  Homelands Falling at `Behest of the ANC' -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 March in a page-12 editorial finds 
it is "not necessarily a bad thing" that the homelands should be 
incorporated into South Africa before their scheduled demise. 
"What is a cause for concern is that it seems to be happening 
at the behest of the ANC and that the fall of each dictator 
serves to remind others where political homage is due." "It is 
hardly a coincidence that the targets are either ANC opponents 
or not slavish devotees, and that the ANC faithful such as 
Transkei military strongman Bantu Holomisa are not threatened by 
riots, pension demands or other `spontaneous' outburts of public 
concern. Worse, as the ultimate objective is Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's kwaZulu, the falling dominoes are more likely to 
harm the cause of free political activity than help it. The 
implied threat, if not to sweep away all opponents before the 
election, is `do as we say, or else'. This may increase 
obduracy in Ulundi rather than lead to negotiated or mediated 
solutions." 
  Criticism of IMF-ANC Agreement Secrecy -- A second editorial 
on the same page notes that the IMF and the ANC "may well have 
agreed" that "state deficit spending targets should not be set 
in concrete. But that felicitous development is unlikely to 
impress cautious businessmen and foreign bankers demanding more 
than just ordinary guarantees of fiscal and monetary rectitude 
of South Africa in this time of abrupt political change. 
Secrecy over the agreement between government, the ANC and the 
IMF on the IMF's special $850m [million] drought relief loan to 
this country added to the insecurities of financiers looking to 
South Africa." 
<H6>  SOWETAN </H6>
  Momentum Toward Dissolution of kwaZulu -- Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 24 March in a page-14 editorial says the 
"domino effect" started by the collapse of Lucas Mangope in 
Bophuthatswana and Oupa Gqozo in Ciskei is likely to raise the 
"political temperature" in kwaZulu/Natal as the elections draw 
nearer. "This is both good and bad news. It is good because 
the re-unification of South Africa is finally about to be 
realised." The bad news is that "the leaders of kwaZulu are not 
going to fall as easily as Bophuthatswana and now Ciskei. There 
is likely to be a fight to the finish, unless the political 
leaders put their country before political ambitions. It is not 
too late for some type of deal to be made with kwaZulu. The 
current events, which seem to have very little to do with the 
so-called ANC-SACP document plotting the overthrow of that 
territory, are gathering momentum towards the dissolution of 
kwaZulu." 
<H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>
  De Klerk `Unable or Unwilling' To Act on Goldstone Report -- 
Referring to the interim report of Judge Richard Goldstone on 
the involvement of senior police officers in gun running and 
"stirring up violence" in the country, Cape Town CAPE TIMES in 
English on 21 March in its page-10 editorial says this issue 
"needs to be assessed by impartial international investigators 
as a matter of urgency and placed before the courts." President 
de Klerk "cannot duck his responsibility" on this matter. "He 
has been obliged to agree to an international presence in the 
investigating team and there is scant chance of yet another 
high-level SAP [South African Police] or MI [Military 
Intelligence] cover-up." "The sad truth is that President de 
Klerk has been unable or unwilling -- and perhaps afraid -- to 
do what has been manifestly necessary to clean up a deadly 
malaise. His position is now unenviable. Of course his 
Minister of Law and Order, Mr Hernus Kriel, must go. It is 
plain that Mr Kriel does not enjoy De Klerk's confidence anyway, 
as he was among the last to be told of the Goldstone 
investigation."
