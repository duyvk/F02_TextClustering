HUNTINGTON BEACH STUDENTS TOIL ON CAMPUS TO LEARN TV CRAFT

Inside the TV control room, the 16-year-old program director, Paul Lear, spoke 
into his headset. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, quiet on the set. Coming up on Camera 1, then cut to 2." 
</P>
<P>
In the adjoining TV studio, the camera crew and on-camera talent tried not to 
show fatigue or irritation. The slate man held up a card that read: "Take No. 
17." A young woman quickly glanced at her cue card. The red light on Camera 1 
flashed on. The young woman smiled and recited her lines -- one more time. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the new CBS-TV network series, "TV 101," about fictional high school 
news broadcasters, this is the real thing. Huntington Beach High School has 
been doing it for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Like TV Series 
</P>
<P>
Louis Polley watched from the hall outside Huntington High's TV newsroom. "It's 
not at all like they show it on that new program, 'TV 101,' " he said. "In that 
show, it seems like they get a take done in three or four minutes. It often 
takes me three or four hours just to do a three-minute segment." 
</P>
<P>
Polley, 16, a junior at Huntington Beach High, is among the on-camera 
performers used in the school's weekly TV news-magazine show, "1905 Main." 
</P>
<P>
"1905 Main St. is the address of our high school," TV teacher Don Messerschmitt 
said. "We used to call the program 'Campus Update.' This year we changed the 
format. It's now more about things in the community, outside the high school, 
and it's a little more sophisticated. So we've changed the name, and we have a 
new set." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach High is among the few schools in Southern California with an 
on-campus TV studio. 
</P>
<P>
"We got our equipment about 10 years ago with a federal grant," Messerschmitt 
said. "Our school wanted to teach kids about the television business and give 
them hands-on experience even before they get to college. It's a very popular 
class, and our kids often go on to major in this in college." 
</P>
<P>
At Huntington Beach High, the weekly 15-minute news program is taped for 
broadcast on Fridays to all classrooms in the school. Each week's tape is also 
given to county cable outlets; it is broadcast on Channel 30 at 4 p.m. on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how many people see the (cable) broadcast and tell me about it," 
said Jenny Casey, 16, a junior and one of the on-camera anchors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Product of the Students 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach High news program is written, directed and produced by 
students. Messerschmitt and another instructor, John Colby, stand by on the set 
to give advice and pointers. But the students operate cameras, write scripts, 
compose original theme music, build props and voice all speaking roles. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural show of the new format included a segment on the national debate 
about whether the right to legal abortion should be overturned in the United 
States. The segment gave background about the U.S. Supreme Court's historic 
abortion ruling, Roe vs. Wade. There were film clips of President Bush and Vice 
President Dan Quayle and their comments opposing abortion during the 1988 
presidential campaign. Interspersed were a balanced number of anti-abortion and 
pro-choice comments by Huntington Beach students. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids in the high school said they didn't like the first show," 
Messerschmitt said. "They said it was too heavy. But the faculty loved it." 
</P>
<P>
The second "1905 Main" program had a segment about forthcoming changes in a 
national fast-food franchise popular with students. There were also segments on 
the history of Valentine's Day and awards won by the rock band Guns and Roses. 
</P>
<P>
Messerschmitt noted that the show always has campus news too, such as sports 
updates. 
</P>
<P>
During a Thursday taping, anchor Kristin Moyer, 18, a senior, went through take 
after take on the rock-band segment until Lear, the young director, was 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it's a pressure job," said Lear, a sophomore, during a break. "But it's 
fun, and I like to be in command, as everybody in this classroom knows. You 
have to watch your temper, though." 
</P>
<P>
Anchorwoman Moyer said she accepts the long hours of taping as part of the 
learning and enjoys the class. "This is what I really like to do," she said. 
"I'm going to take this in college. Then I think it'd be fun to come back to a 
high school and teach a class like this." 
</P>
<P>
One of the student studio technicians, Allen MacDonald, 16, said: "It's great 
to be able to work with real equipment and get the experience." 
</P>
<P>
Studio floor manager Tina Haines, 18, a senior, added: "Having experience like 
this will help me in college. I'm going to major in this." 
</P>
<P>
Messerschmitt said few high schools can afford to buy the TV equipment that 
Huntington Beach High obtained a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Since many students at other high schools in Orange County want to take this 
class, we allow transfers to come to Huntington so they can get this 
experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 20 Hours a Week 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the course involves a lot of work. Students often devote up 
to 20 hours a week in their part of the news show. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very dedicated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday taping was a case in point. News anchor Jenny Casey had been sick 
with flu but showed up for the TV class nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"This, to me, is like a job," Casey said. "It's like a duty. So, yes, I'm still 
sick, but I wasn't about to miss this class."
