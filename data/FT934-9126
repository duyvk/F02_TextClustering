German private steelmakers expressed outrage yesterday at the decision by
Klockner-Werke, the diversified steel group, to sell 75 per cent of its
steel mill for DM4 to a consortium led by the city state of Bremen, writes
Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
Officials at Thyssen, the largest steel group in Germany, said the decision
was purely political and would run against the European Union's efforts to
reduce overcapacity in the European steel industry.
