Preliminary Determination 
We preliminarily determine that sebacic acid from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be,
sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the
Act). The estimated margins are shown in the "Suspension of Liquidation" section of this notice. 
Case History 
Since the initiation of this investigation (58 FR 43339, August 16, 1993), the following events have occurred. 
On August 16, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) sent the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) a mini-Section A questionnaire (i.e., the section regarding sales volume and value). 
On September 2, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of its preliminary determination
that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports
of sebacic acid from the PRC that are allegedly sold at less than fair value. 
On September 27, 1993, MOFTEC submitted its mini-Section A response and on September 30, 1993, the Department sent
MOFTEC the antidumping questionnaire. (This antidumping questionnaire is divided into three sections and two attachments:
(1) Section A requests general information on each company; (2) Section C requests information on, and a listing of,
U.S. sales made during the period of the investigation (POI); (3) Section D requests information on the production
process; (4) Attachment I requests information for a market-oriented industry (MOI) claim; and (5) Attachment II
requests information for a separate rates claim.) As a courtesy, we sent a copy of the questionnaire to those companies
identified as possible exporters of sebacic acid to the United States. 
On September 30, 1993, we requested that the petitioner, four exporters ("respondents") who had entered a notice
of appearance before the Department (Sinochem International Chemicals Company (Sinochem International), Sinochem
Jiangsu Import & Export Corporation, Tianjin Chemicals Import & Export Corporation (Tianjin), and Guangdong
Chemicals Import & Export Corporation (Guangdong)), and MOFTEC submit any publicly available published information
that they wished the Department to consider when valuing the factors of production in this investigation. 
On October 22, 1993, the same four exporters who had entered a notice of appearance submitted responses to Section
A of the questionnaire. On October 29, 1993, we sent each company a Section A deficiency questionnaire. 
On November 1, 1993, the four exporters submitted responses to Sections C and D and Attachments I and II of the questionnaire.
On November 9, 1993, we sent MOFTEC an Attachment I supplemental questionnaire. Also on November 9, 1993, we sent the
four exporters deficiency questionnaires on Sections C and D and Attachment I. 
On November 12, 1993, we received Section A deficiency responses from the four exporters. 
On November 16, 1993, the petitioner and the four exporters submitted publicly available published information.
On November 16, 1993, we sent a letter to each of the 13 non-responding PRC exporters to whom we had sent a copy of the questionnaire.
We again requested that they respond to the Department's questionnaire or provide a certification that they did not
export or sell subject merchandise during the POI. 
Also on November 16, 1993, we sent supplemental Attachment II questionnaires to MOFTEC and the four responding exporters.
On November 19, 1993, the Department sent to the petitioner and the four exporters a publicly available published
information deficiency questionnaire. On November 23, 1993, the petitioner provided comments on the information
submitted by the four exporters. 
On November 26, 1993, we sent a letter to the Guangdong and Jiangsu provincial governments and the Beijing municipal
government requesting information in order to more completely evaluate the issue of whether the four exporters should
receive separate antidumping duty rates. 
On November 29, 1993, we received Sections C and D deficiency responses from the four exporters. 
From November 29, 1993, through December 3, 1993, we received certifications from three Chinese exporters (Sinochem
China National Chemicals Import & Export Corporation, Yunnan Minmetals & Chemicals Import & Export
(Group) Corporation, and Shanghai Chemicals Import and Export Corporation) which state that each entity did not
ship sebacic acid to the United States during the POI. 
On December 3, 1993, the four exporters provided a response to the Department's publicly available published information
deficiency questionnaire. 
On December 13, 1993, we received a letter from MOFTEC objecting to the November 26, 1993, questionnaires we sent to
the provincial and municipal governments. On December 17, 1993, we received a response to our November 26, 1993, separate
rates clarification questionnaire from the Guangdong Commission of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. On December
20, 1993, we received a response from the Jiangsu provincial government.
