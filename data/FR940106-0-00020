One respondent urged that state and local governments and U.S. universities and non-profit research institutes
working independently should be eligible to receive individual ATP awards outside of joint ventures. No change has
been made to the regulation based upon this comment because eligibility for individual awards is expressly limited
to United States companies by section 278n(b)(2) of title 15 of the United States Code.
Effective Date of the Final Rule
This final rule relating to grants, benefits, and contracts is exempt from the delayed effective date requirement,
and accordingly, under section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), is therefore being
made effective immediately without a 30 day delay in effective date.
Classification
This document was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The General Counsel
certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, at the time this rule was proposed that,
if it were adopted as proposed it would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities
requiring a flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This is because there are only a small number
of awardees and thus only a small number of awards will be given to small businesses. The program is entirely voluntary
for the participants that seek funding. It is not a major federal action requiring an environmental assessment under
the National Environment Policy Act. This rule contains collection of information requirements subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act approved by OMB under control number 0693-0009. The Advanced Technology Program does not involve
the mandatory payment of any matching funds from a state or local government, and does not affect directly any state
or local government. Accordingly, the Technology Administration has determined that Executive Order 12372 is not
applicable to this program. This notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant
preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.
