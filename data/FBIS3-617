  [Text] The Supreme Court yesterday gave reasons for its 
ruling against the celebration of 31 December as a public 
holiday and funding the celebrations from public funds. It 
would be recalled that on 29 December 1993, the court gave a 
five-four majority decision in favor of a writ filed by the New 
Patriotic Party [NPP]. In the writ, the NPP sought from the 
Supreme Court a declaration making it unconstitutional for the 
government to declare 31 December as a public holiday. 
  Five justices of the Supreme Court ruled that the 
celebration 
was unconstitutional. They are Justices N.Y.B. Adade, G.R.M. 
Francois, K.E. Amoah-Sakyi, G.E.K. Aikins, and C.F. 
Hayfron-Benjamin. Those who dissented are the Chief Justice, 
Mr. Justice Philip Archer, and Justices Abban, A.K.B. Appiah, 
and Mrs. Justice Bamford Addo. It took the nine judges eight 
and half hours to give reasons for their judgment. 
  The chief justice, Mr. Justice Archer, said in his opinion 
he 
did not see the celebration as unconstitutional. He said under 
the public holiday's ordnance, it is only the executive and the 
legislature that have the right to declare public holidays. He 
said the court should not be made to extend its hands to areas 
which are unconstitutional and illegal to tread. Mr. Justice 
Archer said if people feel the need that the day should not be 
celebrated they should submit to parliament to change the 
schedule of PNDC [Provisional National Defense Council] Law 220, 
the public holidays law. He also said since parliament 
judiciously voted money for the celebration, in his opinion, it 
is constitutional that public funds could be used to finance the 
celebration. 
  Mr. Justice Abban said the indemnity clause in the 
Constitution makes the suit null and void. He said the behavior 
of Ghanaians toward the coups of 1966, 1972, 1979, and 31 
December 1981, as well as the indemnity clauses in the 1969, 
1979, and 1992 Constitutions made the coups historically vain. 
Mr. Justice Abban said the argument that the celebration of 31 
December was discriminatory was not sound. He said if such a 
submission was upheld then the declaration of 25 December, the 
birth of Christ, Good Friday, and such days could as well be 
challenged by other non-Christian religious groups. He said it 
must be clear that the declaration of public holidays is a 
political issue and that it is the people through their elected 
representatives who should set aside such days. 
  Mrs. Justice Bamford Addo said it is not for the judiciary 
to 
formulate public policies. She said the suit is caught by 
Article 34 of the Constitution and that should it be even 
accepted that the celebration is unconstitutional, that clause 
will still override findings. 
  Mr. Justice N.Y.B. Adade, one of the five judges who agreed 
that the declaration of 31 December as a public holiday is 
unconstitutional, submitted that the celebration of the day has 
the tendency of playing up the idea of military coups, which 
contravenes the spirit and letter of the Constitution. He said 
the indemnity clause in the Constitution accepts the illegality 
of the event of 31 December 1981. He said that if it is 
accepted that the celebration is constitutional, the flood gates 
are being opened for other coup d'etat days to be celebrated. 
  Mr. Justice Francois said the day could be celebrated 
provided it is not funded from public funds. He said the 1992 
Constitution buried the immediate past and imposed an embargo on 
future coups. He said the indemnity clause exempts coup makers 
from penalties for their actions. 
  In his judgment Mr. Justice Amoah-Sakyi said 24 February, 13 
January, June 4, and 31 December -- the days coups were staged 
in Ghana -- ceased to be public holidays immediately democracy 
was restored. He said the court is to make all agencies of 
government to act within the parameters of the law. Mr. Justice 
Amoah-Sakyi concluded: We have had enough of coup d'etats, we 
want it no more. 
  Mr. Justice G.E.K. Aikins held the view that the celebration 
and financing of the day are unconstitutional and an affront to 
democracy. He said but for the indemnity clauses, all those who 
stage coups would be tried after a constitutional government is 
restored. This, he said, implies the unconstitutionality of 
celebrating such days as public holidays. He said any law that 
is inconsistent with the Constitution is declared null and void. 
It is the view of Mr. Justice Aikins that PNDC Law 220, the 
public holiday law, has some inconsistencies when tested with 
the spirit and letter of the 1992 Constitution. He said those 
inconsistencies had made the law void. Consequently, it will be 
unconstitutional to celebrate the day.
