It is an ironic paradox that many psychoanalysts who profess to be most loyally 
devoted to the theories of Sigmund Freud are nevertheless among the strongest 
advocates of the view that homosexuality per se constitutes a mental disorder. 
Yet Freud himself clearly did not consider it so, stating that it can occur "in 
people who exhibit no other serious deviations from the normal . . . and who 
are indeed distinguished by specially high intellectual development and ethical 
culture" and adding: "Wouldn't that oblige us to characterize as sick many 
great thinkers and scholars of all time, whose perverse orientation we know for 
a fact and whom we admire precisely because of their mental health?"

The author of "The Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality," Kenneth Lewes, 
a psychoanalytically trained psychologist, set himself the challenging test of 
reviewing almost every psychoanalytic article and book written about male 
homosexuality. Unhappily, his review has covered a rather dismal record. Almost 
without exception, the early psychoanalysts (and most contemporary ones) who 
wrote about homosexuality made the egregious error of generalizing from small 
samples of emotionally disturbed homosexual patients to the homosexual 
population at large, and (assuming that all homosexuals were essentially alike) 
of filling their pages with stereotypic conclusions about "the homosexual" and 
the "homosexual personality." 
</P>
<P>
But, even worse, not recognizing their own built-in emotional biases, almost 
all of them (with a few honorable exceptions) not only took it for granted that 
homosexual behavior was "unnatural" and needed to be "cured" but sometimes 
commented about their homosexual patients in ways that revealed a shocking 
contempt for them. Thus, Dr. Edmund Bergler, the most important psychoanalytic 
"expert" on homosexuality in the 1950s, wrote: "Homosexuals are essentially 
disagreeable people . . . (displaying) a mixture of superciliousness, false 
aggression, and whimpering . . . subservient when confronted with a strong 
person, merciless when in power, and unscrupulous about trampling on a weaker 
person." In a similar vein, Dr. Charles Socarides, considered one of the 
leading contemporary psychoanalytic authorities on the subject, has written: 
"Homosexuality . . . is filled with aggression, destruction, and self-defeat, 
and is a masquerade of life . . . (involving) only destruction, mutual defeat, 
and exploitation of the partner and the self." 
</P>

Little wonder that Lewes, at one point, can't help shedding his scholarly 
dispassionateness, exclaiming: "It is shocking that Bergler's colleagues let 
such . . . attitudes go without rebuke. Such intemperance severely compromised 
psychoanalytic discourse about homosexuality . . . and sullied the 
psychoanalytic tradition of sympathy and tolerance." 
</P>

As Lewes outlines the evolution of psychoanalytic theories about homosexuality, 
he winds his way through an intricate and abstruse maze of often mutually 
contradictory concepts. There are long passages dealing with esoteric 
speculations attributing the origins of homosexuality to the search for the 
lost penis in the father, regression to orality or anality, castration anxiety, 
incest guilt, incomplete separation from the mother, narcissistic 
identifications, and even to "testicular anxiety" and an infantile fear of 
losing feces! Regrettably, Lewes himself contributes to the confusion by 
assuming that there are "different kinds of homosexuality" -- i.e., normal, 
psychotic, borderline, etc., failing to understand that homosexuals can develop 
the same variety of mental disorders that heterosexuals do and that these do 
not constitute different "homosexualities" any more than they do different 
"heterosexualities."

It was not until the 1970s that psychoanalytic formulations about homosexuality 
began to take an entirely new course, with the recognition that not all 
homosexuals were mentally ill, that their love for one another could be as 
fully developed and genuine as that between heterosexuals and that they were 
capable of living stable lives and functioning responsibly and honorably, often 
in positions of high trust. These views were abetted by a number of significant 
new research reports on non-patient homosexual populations, among them a 
classic study by Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a UCLA psychologist, demonstrating that 
careful psychological testing of a group of non-patient homosexuals revealed no 
demonstrable pathology that differentiated them in any way from a matched group 
of heterosexuals.

Pressures began to develop in the psychiatric community to remove homosexuality 
from its listing as a mental illness in the American Psychiatric Assn.'s 
Official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. A historic debate ensued within the 
APA, with psychoanalysts leading the polemic on both sides. Irving Bieber, a 
psychoanalyst who had published an influential group-research study of male 
homosexuals in analytic treatment (a study that encountered severe 
methodological criticism because all of the subjects were, a priori, 
emotionally disturbed individuals), and Socarides fought strongly against the 
deletion. Robert Stoller, Richard Green and this reviewer, all from Los 
Angeles, played important roles in urging the change. This view finally 
prevailed when the APA Board of Trustees, in 1973, voted to delete 
homosexuality from the list of mental disorders. Unhappy with this outcome, 
Bieber and Socarides pushed for a national membership referendum on the issue, 
and, to their surprise and chagrin, a majority of the psychiatrists voting 
upheld the board's decision.

Lewes' book is not one for the general reader. Its greatest appeal will be to 
psychoanalytically-oriented professionals and highly sophisticated lay people. 
His approach is a broad and tolerant one, although he is clearly more 
fascinated with classical Freudian libido theory than are many contemporary 
psychoanalysts, whom he pejoratively labels "revisionists." For the student of 
homosexuality, however, the greatest weakness of the book is its failure to 
give any inkling of the exciting new biological findings about the origins of 
variant sexual orientation -- e.g., the growing body of research evidence that 
a significant proportion of male homosexuals are biologically predisposed at 
birth to become homosexual by virtue of variations in the degree to which they 
have been exposed to circulating male sex hormones during their intra-uterine 
development. These variations, although not causative in and of themselves, 
appear to have a fateful effect on the male child's subsequent temperament, 
life experiences and interpersonal relationships and to favor the development 
of a homosexual orientation. In such children, homosexual inclinations from 
early life on are as "natural" as heterosexual inclinations are to most other 
males and are definitely not a matter of "choice."
