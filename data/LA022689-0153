If you're planning a long stay in Mexico, check into the Golden Pass program of 
Los Angeles-based Mexico Travel Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
The program offers 15 or 30 consecutive nights at six Hoteles Dubin in Mexico 
City, Taxco, Acapulco and Tehuacan. You can create your own itinerary and 
divide your time between any of the hotels and cities. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you can spend some time in Mexico City, go to Taxco and Acapulco, 
then return to Mexico City. Accommodations, however, are on a space-available 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
Two a la carte meals a day -- an American breakfast and lunch or dinner -- are 
part of the program. You can choose the menu. Beverages, including coffee, tea 
and tips are extra, but hotel and food taxes are included in the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Until April 30 the 15-day pass costs $299 per person, the 30-day $499. These 
are the same prices as during the 1987-88 winter season. It averages less than 
$20 a night for the 15-day pass and close to $17 a night for the longer pass. 
</P>
<P>
The program will continue beyond April 30, but costs for then are not yet 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels in Mexico City participating in the program are the Reforma and Vasco de 
Quiroga, both in the capital's central Pink Zone, which has or is close to many 
popular attractions. 
</P>
<P>
In Taxco you have a choice between the Hotel de la Borda or Hotel Rancho 
Taxco-Victoria. You can also sleep at one hotel in Taxco while having dining 
privileges at the other. 
</P>
<P>
The Casablanca Hotel in Acapulco is not a beach property. It's on a hill 
overlooking the city and the bay in the old part of town, offering sweeping 
views. 
</P>
<P>
The Hacienda Spa Penafiel is used in Tehuacan. An inland city with 
colonial/historic attractions as well as spa resorts, Tehuacan is not far from 
Oaxaca and Puebla. The pass includes play at a nine-hole golf course in 
Tehuacan. 
</P>
<P>
At least the first night's room should be booked before departure. Subsequent 
reservations in Mexico can be made at your hotel or at any of MTA's offices in 
Mexico City and Acapulco. No refunds for unused nights. Contact travel agents.
