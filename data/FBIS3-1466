  [Text] Durban March 28 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] on Monday said it deplored attacks on Zulu marchers and 
bystanders in Johannesburg's city centre earlier in the day. 
"We request the Goldstone Commission to investigate the 
massacre as an urgent priority and to appoint both local and 
international investigators," read a statement issued by Ed 
Tillett on behalf of the IFP. "Zulu marchers in support of King 
(Goodwill) Zwelithini's declaration of Zulu sovereignty were 
fired upon by unidentified gunmen," it continued. 
  "Reports have also been received that shots were fired on 
marchers from assassins who concealed themselves within the 
ranks of march participants. The marchers were also fired upon 
by strategically positioned rooftop snipers. Their presence was 
confirmed by a large number of independent witnesses. The 
attacks were clearly well planned and added a sinister new 
dimension to political violence in this country. The majority 
of the shooting victims were Zulus. 
  "Earlier today the IFP received information of an alleged 
African National Congress plot to infiltrate agent provocateurs 
among Zulu marchers. These elements were instructed to fire 
randomly on march participants with the intention of triggering 
a violent counter-response in order to discredit its (Zulu) 
organisers and link the accompanying chaos to the IFP." 
  The statement continued: "In the wake of the attacks, the 
IFP believes the ANC is attempting to create a climate of fear 
and hysteria in the country which would justify a Transitional 
Executive Council-led crackdown against those standing outside 
of the ANC and National Party-defined transition process."
