Example 3 
Species-Related Hazards and Controls No. 1 
Hazard No. 1 (Safety)_Chemical Contamination Other Than Methyl 
Mercury 
Contamination of Raw Material at Receipt with Pesticides, 
Radioactivity, Toxic Elements, and Industrial Chemicals, Derived 
From the Harvest Area. 
Hazard Statement 
Fish and molluscan shellfish may be harvested from waters 
that are exposed to varying amounts of environmental 
contaminants. Industrial chemicals, pesticides, and many toxic 
elements may accumulate in fish at levels that can cause public 
health problems. Concern for these contaminants primarily 
focuses on fish and shellfish harvested from fresh water, 
estuaries, and near-coastal waters rather than from the open 
ocean. Pesticides and herbicides used near aquaculture 
operations or for other purposes may contaminate fish and fishery 
products. 
Federal tolerances or action levels are established for some 
of the most toxic and persistent contaminants that are found in 
fish and fishery products shipped in interstate commerce. (These 
contaminants and their corresponding limits are listed below.) 
When products exceed these limits, FDA can seize the contaminated 
fish and fishery products. 
States often use the limits for deciding whether to issue 
consumption advisories or to close or classify waters for 
harvesting. Molluscan shellfish waters are controlled by the 
State Shellfish Control Agency (SSCA) or the equivalent in 
foreign countries that have Memoranda of Understanding with the 
United States that permit them to export molluscan shellfish to 
this country. If local or regional contaminants are not covered 
by federal limits, contact local health departments to decide if 
contaminant levels in fish and fishery products are of public 
health concern. 
The control measures provided in this section are 
appropriate for the control of methyl mercury contamination in 
fish, where such contamination is the result of industrial 
contamination in a harvest area. Recommended controls for the 
problem of open ocean species, such as swordfish and shark, 
concentrating methyl mercury from their diet and its diffuse 
presence in the environment are provided in the "Mercury" hazard 
section. 
Critical Control Point: Receiving 
There are five options for control at this critical control 
point. 
Option 1 
Where the firm receives wild caught fish, other than 
molluscan shellfish, directly from the fisher or from a supplier 
that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a 
tender or related company that pools fish from various fishers), 
the following applies:
Control Measures 
1. Find out the harvest area location for each lot or batch 
from the fisher upon receipt. 
2. Find out whether the harvest area is closed to fishing 
by foreign, Federal, State or local health authorities due to 
known instances of chemical contamination. 
3. Reject fish that have been caught in a closed area. 
Example 
ABC Fish Co. has contacted the State Department of 
Health and learned that the Long River is closed to 
commercial harvest above Lookout Point, including its 
tributaries, due to the presence of chlordecone 
(Kepone
TM
). The species affected are croaker, 
bluefish, and striped bass. ABC Fish Co., which 
processes these species, will reject any of the listed 
species originating from the area.
