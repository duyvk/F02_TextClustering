After a review of alternatives analyzed in the EA, the Council selected Alternative 3 as the preferred alternative.
This alternative is projected in modeling simulations to rebuild POP biomass to a target level (B
MSY
) in about 14 years by harvesting POP at a fishing mortality rate lower than the optimum rate. The target biomass B
MSY
 is the total biomass of mature females that would produce the maximum sustainable yield, on average; this number is
currently estimated at 150,000 mt. The optimal fishing mortality rate is the rate that maximizes expected biological
and economic yields over a range of plausible stock-recruitment relationships.
The Council considered Alternative 3 superior to Alternative 1, which no longer represents the best scientific information
about POP biomass and population dynamics. The Council also considered Alternative 3 superior to Alternative 2,
which would harvest POP at the higher optimal fishing mortality rate. The Council believed that lower POP harvests
and additional economic costs of Alternative 3 were justified because Alternative 2 would achieve the target biomass
in a longer time (about 18 years) and with a lower probability of rebuilding success. Alternative 4 would harvest POP
at a lower rate equivalent needed for unavoidable POP bycatch in remaining groundfish fisheries, at 1992 bycatch
rates. The TACs resulting from Alternative 4 were considered too restrictive in relation to existing POP bycatch
needs, causing unnecessary discards of POP that are killed in fishing operations after POP TACs are reached.
Under Alternative 3, the FMP would establish the procedure for deriving the annual GOA TACs for POP. POP stocks are
considered to be rebuilt when the total biomass of mature females is equal to, or greater than, B
MSY
. Annual TACs would be established as follows:
(a) Determine the current biomass, B
MSY
, and the optimal fishing mortality rate;
(b) Determine the fishing mortality rate halfway between the optimal fishing mortality rate and the fishing mortality
rate estimated to be sufficient to supply unavoidable bycatch of POP based on 1992 bycatch rates;
(c) When the current biomass of mature females is less than B
MSY
, adjust the resultant fishing mortality rate in (b) by the ratio of current biomass to B
MSY
 so that when B
MSY
 is attained, the fishing mortality rate will be the optimal fishing mortality rate;
(d) The GOA TAC of POP is the amount of fish resulting from the adjusted fishing mortality rate in (c); and
(e) The TAC is apportioned among regulatory areas in proportion to POP biomass distribution.
In addition to restricting the annual fishing mortality rate of POP, the Council seeks to reduce the total mortality
of POP in other target fisheries. In the past, overfishing has been defined GOA-wide. Under Amendment 32, the overfishing
level would be distributed among the eastern, central, and western areas in the same proportions as POP biomass occurs
in those areas. This measure would avoid localized depletion of POP and would rebuild POP at equal rates in all regulatory
areas of the GOA. The Council considers this management option necessary because, although POP biomass is greatest
in the Eastern Regulatory Area, most trawl fishing activity and incidental catch of POP is greatest in the Central
Regulatory Area. With an acceptable biological catch as low as the current, 3,378 mt in 1993, fishing mortality of
POP can be expected to exceed the TAC available in the central GOA.
Amendment 32 is necessary to improve conservation and management of POP and is intended to further the goals and objectives
of the FMP. No regulatory changes are necessary to implement this FMP amendment because the FMP would provide the procedure
for deriving TACs for POP, which are specified annually under existing regulations at Sect.672.20(a)(2).
