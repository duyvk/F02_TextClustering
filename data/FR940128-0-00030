SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 This revision to part 336 revises the part heading from "Exhaustion of Rights to Benefits" to "Duration of Normal
and Extended Benefits", and consists of two subparts. Subpart A explains how long a qualified railroad employee
may receive normal unemployment and sickness benefits. Subpart B explains under what circumstances an employee
with 10 or more years of railroad service may receive extended unemployment or sickness benefits and the duration
of an employee's extended benefit period. This rule also removes existing Sect.336.3, which relates to payment
of extended unemployment benefits under the Temporary Extended Railroad Unemployment Insurance Benefits Act of
1961. Extended benefits are no longer payable under that Act. As revised, Sect.336.3 explains the duration of normal
sickness benefits under the RUIA. 
On August 17, 1993, the Board published this rule as a proposed rule (58 FR 43577), inviting comments on or before September
16, 1993. No comments were received. 
The Board has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order No. 12866;
therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. The information collection requirements contained in this
rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0070.

Subpart A_Normal Benefits 
Sect.336.1 
Introduction. 
(a) 
General.
 This subpart explains how long a qualified employee may receive normal unemployment or sickness benefits under the
Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act during a benefit year. Under section 2(c) of that Act, normal unemployment benefits
are payable for up to 130 days of unemployment within a benefit year, or in an amount equal to the amount of the employee's
"base year compensation", whichever is less. A similar limitation applies to the payment of sickness benefits.
An employee who exhausts his or her normal unemployment or sickness benefits may be eligible for payment of extended
unemployment or extended sickness benefits under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part. 
(b) 
Definitions.
 The terms "benefit year", "base year", and "compensation" are defined in part 302 of this chapter. The term
"registration period" is defined in parts 325 and 335 of this chapter. For the purposes of this subpart, and as explained
in Sect.336.4 of this part, an employee's "base year compensation" may include compensation in excess of the monthly
compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) even though such excess may not be counted for the purpose
of determining whether such employee is a "qualified employee" within the meaning of part 302. 
(c) 
Recovery of benefits.
 When unemployment or sickness benefits are recovered by the Board for one or more days, the Board will disregard those
days in determining whether the employee has exhausted normal unemployment or sickness benefits with respect to
the applicable benefit year. 
Sect.336.2 Duration of normal unemployment benefits. 
(a) 
130 compensable day limitation.
 A qualified employee who has satisfied the waiting period for a benefit year may receive benefits for a maximum of 130
days of unemployment within such benefit year, subject to the limitation on payment explained in paragraph (b) of
this section. In any registration period beginning after the end of the waiting period and before the beginning of
the next ensuing benefit year, benefits are payable for days of unemployment in excess of four, but the aggregate number
of compensable days may not exceed 130 for the benefit year. An employee who is unemployed on all days during a registration
period could have a maximum of 10 compensable days of unemployment in such registration period. The amount of benefits
for each compensable day of unemployment is the amount of the daily benefit rate computed for such employee pursuant
to part 330 of this chapter.
