  [Text] A former leader of the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front], General Constand Viljoen, has 
resigned from the Freedom Alliance. This was announced at a 
Freedom Alliance meeting in Kimberley today. Speaking after the 
meeting, IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi said the Alliance had agreed that General Viljoen 
should resign so that he could lead his Freedom Front in the 
election. General Viljoen said that he was prepared to join the 
Freedom Alliance as the leader of the Freedom Front. Meanwhile, 
the former Conservative Party leader in Natal, Mr. Carl Werth, 
has confirmed that eight of the region's 11 executive members 
have agreed to stand as candidates for the Freedom Front. He 
said that they had taken the decision at a recent meeting. 
Leaders of the Freedom Alliance meeting expressed strong 
disapproval of the deposing of Dr. Lucas Mangope as president of 
Bophuthatswana. Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Dr. Mangope had 
been betrayed and stabbed in the back. He said there was a need 
for the alliance to review its position following the weekend's 
events. 
  A Conservative Party spokesman said the events in 
Bophuthatswana had been planned by the ANC [African National 
Congress] through the Transitional Executive Council, to deprive 
the state of its independence.
