ACTION: 
Notice of opportunity to join a cooperative research and development consortium .
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), seeks industrial and academic parties interested in
entering into a cooperative research consortium on the development of open systems technology for virtual libraries
and electronic document interchange. This program will be undertaken within the scope and confines of The Federal
Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 3710a), which provides federal laboratories including NIST, with the
authority to enter into cooperative research agreements with qualified parties. Under this law, NIST may contribute
personnel, equipment, and facilities_but no funds_to the cooperative research program. Members will be expected
to make contribution to the consortium's efforts in the form of materials, equipment, personnel, and/or funds. The
research program is expected to last two to three years. This is not a grant program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks industrial and academic parties interested in entering
into a cooperative research consortium on the development of open systems technology for virtual libraries and electronic
document interchange. NIST wishes to pursue interoperable and portable open systems that will improve the use of
information technology in conducting government programs and in providing services to the public, and, in particular,
improve the use and exchange of electronic documents in many forms as an aid to the performance of daily business activities
and research activities.
The open information systems movement is gaining momentum because many researchers and users realize that no single
vendor can supply all the needs for an information-based society. Open systems are needed to provide for interoperability
of software, hardware, and communications systems products, and for portability of data and applications across
heterogeneous computing environments. While there is a strong movement to standards for interconnecting hardware,
software and network systems, there are many proprietary products and systems in use. NIST has developed the application
Portability Profile (APP), the U.S. Government's Open system Environment Profile, which integrates standards
and other specifications to address a broad range of information technology requirements.
The purpose of this consortium is to develop technology that will promote the exchange of electronic documents and
improve user access to information in various forms and locations. This technology will fit into the APP framework.
This program is being undertaken within the scope and confines of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub.
L. 99-502, 15 U.S.C. 3710a) which authorizes government owned and operated federal laboratories, including
NIST, to enter into cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with qualified parties. Under the
law, a CRADA may provide for contributions from the federal laboratory of personnel, facilities, and equipment,
but not direct funding.
