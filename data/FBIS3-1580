  [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Association of Science and Technology (CAST) must work hard to 
promote the application of scientific results to production and 
the improvement of the country's science and technology, both a 
senior Chinese leader and a top CAST head said today. 
  Alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China Wen Jiabao and CAST 
Chairman Zhu Guangya voiced the requirement at a national 
conference of CAST, which began here today. 
  The tasks set for the non-governmental scientific 
organization this year include: improving the production 
technologies and management of large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, developing new products and new 
technologies, enhancing agricultural technologies, and doing 
research work on major regional and inter-regional development 
projects. 
  According to an investigation conducted in 17 provinces, 
autonomous regions and cities, 1.1 million scientists and 
technical experts last year participated in 9,000 projects in 
transforming scientific results into productivity. 
  "The economic turnover amounted to 3.23 billion yuan (about 
660 million U.S. dollars then)," CAST's Zhu Guangya said. 
  Zhu said his association, a link between the government and 
the nation's scientists and technicians, will also provide the 
government with advice and opinions on national policies and 
development plans. 
  He said that CAST will strengthen its efforts in running 
scientific institutions and enterprises to better equip itself 
to fulfill its social responsibilities. 
  Wen Jiabao asked CAST to promote the establishment of 
China's 
new scientific and technological framework. 
  The new system should be suited to the development of a 
socialist market economy and the law on scientific and 
technological development, and characterized by a close union 
between the economy and science and technology, Wen said. 
  Wen said the Communist Party of China and the government 
have 
always been ready to listen to the opinions and requests of 
intellectuals, to bring their initiative and creativity into 
full play. 
  CAST, a national scientific association for the public good 
established in 1958, now has 4 million members across the 
country.
