It's a far cry from the synthesizers of Joe Zawinul's Weather Report to the 
happening scene of rap. But, somehow, the Vienna-born keyboard master who 
co-led the jazz/rock fusion group with Wayne Shorter from 1970 to 1985 has 
bridged the gap. His best known composition, "Birdland," which became a disco 
hit for Weather Report in the 1970s is on the charts again, this time as part 
of Quincy Jones' smash "Back on the Block," currently one of the country's Top 
10 albums, already certified platinum. 
</P>
<P>
Zawinul in the post-Weather Report years has flitted about among fusion, jazz, 
pop vocal (sometimes with messages) and classical music. 
</P>
<P>
Just before leaving his Malibu home last week for a concert stint with a full 
orchestra in Cologne, he waxed ecstatic about the new testament. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just gotten back from a trip to Japan with the Zawinul Syndicate and 
found a message that Quincy Jones was looking for me," Zawinul said. "He needed 
the exact line; he had seen lead sheets but wanted to have it exactly the way I 
wrote it. He said, 'Hey man I'm going to record it and I want to use rappers. 
I'd like to turn on a lot of young folks, the black kids especially, who never 
saw Birdland but need to know what it represented.' " 
</P>
<P>
Birdland was the self-described "Jazz Corner of the World" from 1949 until it 
closed in 1965. "All of us in Vienna knew about this fabulous place. Friederich 
Gulda, the great pianist, played there with a jazz group and told me all about 
it. We all dreamed about visiting Birdland some day." 
</P>
<P>
His dream was realized not long after he emigrated in 1959. After working 
briefly in Maynard Ferguson's band, he toured for almost two years as Dinah 
Washington's accompanist, even working with her at the now legendary club at 
Broadway and 52nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
"That club made such an impact on me," Zawinul said. "I met Miles (Davis) 
there, and Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong; I met my wife Maxine there. 
Everyone I worshiped I met at Birdland." 
</P>
<P>
When Zawinul wrote the song, his manager was skeptical. "Who cares about Bird 
or Birdland?" Zawinul was adamant: "I don't care what you say, that's what I 
want to call it. And, of course, it was not only a big hit then in the 1970s, 
but also when Jon Hendricks set lyrics to it in the '80s and Manhattan Transfer 
recorded it, they won the Grammy. So now we're in the '90s and it's on an album 
that will sell 10 times as many as all the rest together." 
</P>
<P>
For his role on the Jones record, Zawinul used the Korg Pepe. "That's a little 
instrument I invented, with a bassoon-like mouthpiece. I played that in the 
title tune, 'Back on the Block.' On 'Birdland,' I just played a synth bass line 
on the introduction. Quincy gave me complete freedom to do what I liked; I 
could have been with Cannonball's band (of which he was a member from 1961-70) 
or with my own band." 
</P>
<P>
He gives Jones credit for using the album to introduce a new generation to 
timeless sounds. "All of a sudden those kids on the street hear Dizzy and Miles 
and James Moody and Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. Hey, he's done something 
important to get as many people as possible interested in an art form that is 
more alive than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Jones agrees. "I've felt for a long time that there was a correlation between 
hip-hop and be-bop," he said by telephone from New York. "That's today 
language, and they are both forms of rebellion. One of the biggest kicks for me 
was hearing my 12-year-old grandson, Sunny D, saying that 'Birdland' was his 
favorite tune on the album, and then asking, 'Grandpa, who's Miles Davis? Who's 
Ella?' I just came back from a tour of six countries, and this sort of thing is 
happening all over." 
</P>
<P>
The Jones interlude was just one brief moment in a schedule that has maintained 
Zawinul's role as an intercontinental idiom-hopper. He has been to Europe 14 
times in the last 18 months, sometimes with his Zawinul Syndicate but often for 
classical ventures with his old friend Gulda. 
</P>
<P>
"With Gulda I've played Brahms' 'Variations for Two Pianos' and some Mozart and 
some of our own things," Zawinul said. "I was at the Salzburg Festival last 
year when Herbert von Karajan was still alive, and I started out with jazz, 
which at one time they wouldn't allow. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I did the Mozart with the orchestra, and after the concert we all went 
over to the Dom Platz and I played with my own band for two or three hours. A 
triumph! This year we did the same thing, but it was with Gulda and Herbie 
Hancock and me, with dual acoustic pianos. 
</P>
<P>
"In May I'll have my own special day at the Weiner Festival; next year they're 
giving me two days, and for 1995, when we have the World's Fair in Vienna, I've 
been commissioned to write a symphony and a musical show." 
</P>
<P>
Zawinul's evolution during his three U.S.-based decades has been unremitting 
and exemplary since his formative era as big band pianist, accompanist to 
singers and longtime Adderley associate. It was in Cannonball's Quintet that he 
wrote his first pop-jazz hit, "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy" and since then, he has been 
on an endless voyage of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
But, along with experiments, he has never totally lost touch with the jazz 
breeding ground that set him on his way. In the latest album, "Black Water" 
(Columbia CK 44316), he plays "Monk's Mood" as a piano solo much as he might 
have played it in the pre-fusion years, then segues into another Monk piece, 
"Little Rootie Tootie," in which he offers a puckish solo on the Korg Pepe. 
</P>
<P>
On another tune, "Medicine Man," he plays the accordion, an instrument he took 
up as a youngster in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Zawinul's powerful social conscience comes through too: The message in the 
title tune, for which his bassist Gerald Veasley supplied the lyrics, is a 
strong indictment of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
And "Black Water"is a family affair. Ivan Zawinul, 21, was involved in the 
computer programming as well as various instrumental and vocal overdubs. "He's 
my full time engineer," his father says. Erich Zawinul, 24, now living in 
Vienna, is a graphic artist who designed the cover. Anthony Zawinul, 28, works 
in a law office but has been working on movie scores and is the 
composer/performer on "And So It Goes," the last cut in "Black Water." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, as he has diversified his career, Zawinul has encountered 
criticism. In a recent interview the New York bop pianist Barry Harris said of 
Weather Report: "What kills me about those kinds of groups is that when someone 
has a jazz festival they bring these cats together and call them a jazz group. 
I say they've ceased to be jazz musicians. I know the cats like Joe Zawinul can 
play all the standards; but they haven't been jazz musicians for 10 or 15 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Zawinul, who is the last musician likely to be accused of a lack of 
self-confidence, laughed. "I like Barry Harris; I have no problem with what 
people say. He is one of the finest, but he's a copy of Bud Powell. 
</P>
<P>
"I have arrived, you see. Last summer at the Montmartre in Copenhagen they had 
a list of coming attractions. They had Betty Carter, and they identified her as 
a jazz vocalist. They billed some band and described it as a rock group. But 
with my name they had no description. They just said 'Zawinul.' Not jazz, not 
rock, just me. I am my own category."
