  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- The mood of the Zulu 
marchers was "very reasonable" and did not look as if the 
protest was going to erupt in violence, Democratic Party [DP] MP 
and PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Peace Secretariat 
member Rupert Lorimer told SAPA on Monday evening. He said he 
was at the meeting at the Library Gardens when the shooting 
started. 
  Both Mr Lorimer and National Peace Secretariat Chairman Dr 
Antonie Gildenhuys had marched through the middle of the crowd 
on its way to the rally and "the crowd was at that stage in a 
fairly good mood", Mr Lorimer said. "There was nothing that we 
saw that could have induced shooting. 
  "Suddenly, out of the blue, shooting started. I did not know 
where it came from. Some of it was from the ground and some 
from the buildings around the gardens," Mr Lorimer said, adding 
that police then trained their fire on buildings, breaking many 
upper storey windows. The crowd took cover and Dr Gildenhuys 
and I ended face-down in flower beds in the gardens while an 
impi [Zulu word for warrior] ran over my back," he said. 
  Although Mr Lorimer was not at the scene of the carnage at 
the African National Congress head office, Shell House, where 
eight people were killed, he said the shooting there was not a 
Zulu attack. 
  According to people Mr Lorimer spoke to, someone started 
firing from buildings opposite and around Shell House and the 
crowd retaliated, he told SAPA. 
  Mr Lorimer also believed there were agents provocateur in 
the 
crowd, as he had been warned by the IFP before the march. He 
said both the Peace Secretariat and the police had difficulty 
placing their men in the crowd because both organisations were 
operating on rumours about the march. 
  Mr Lorimer said he had seen a large number of "sticks, 
assegais [jabbing spear] and homemade spears, but no firearms 
among the marchers".
