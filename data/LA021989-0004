<P>
ON A SHADY STREET IN Santa Monica, the trim white house, enclosed like a warm 
secret by a low-clipped hedge, is quiet. Inside, a 2 1/2-year-old boy lies in a 
darkened room on his Mickey Mouse sheets, his blond hair falling in wet strings 
across his forehead, his pillow still damp with the perspiration that comes 
with deep sleep in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
His mother isn't home. Instead, a Salvadoran woman hovers near the nursery 
door. "Hi, Michael. No sleeping?" 
</P>
<P>
Marta Perez * sweeps in wearing a loose floral housedress. She has kicked off 
her shoes to accommodate feet that tend to swell slightly late in the day. "Up, 
hola! Feet down, please. Vaya, good!" 
</P>
<P>
While Perez dresses the boy in overalls and a shirt printed with He-Man 
figures, they converse with all the spirit and creativity of a chatty woman new 
to the English language and a chatty toddler new to any language at all. 
</P>
<P>
Even a first-time visitor to this house can read the silent details that spell 
out a modern family's concern for its children. On the kitchen counter is a 
homemade cherry pie baked by the boy's mother, Sally Cooper, before she left 
for work. Taped to the refrigerator, among the finger paintings, is a barbecue 
invitation from Cooper's Lamaze group. In the den, next to a framed photo of 
the boy, are the videotapes: "Sesame Street" and pregnancy exercise routines. 
</P>
<P>
When Cooper comes home at 5 p.m. she sinks her six-months-pregnant body down on 
the living-room couch and regards her son and Perez fondly as they march past 
on their way out to the yard. "He adores her," she says simply. 
</P>
<P>
An experiment is unfolding here. The Cooper house is a laboratory of sorts 
where Latino and Anglo worlds are touching in an extended, intimate, first 
meeting. In unprecedented numbers, all over Southern California, women like 
Sally Cooper are hiring women like Marta Perez to come into their homes and 
take care of their children. Such arrangements will surely affect the future of 
this region, where rapid demographic change means that the Anglo and Latino 
worlds soon are bound either to mesh or to clash on a grander scale. 
</P>
<P>
SALLY COOPER WAS NOT born to a life of luxury in which servants were taken for 
granted. She and her husband, Don, a contractor, are on their way up. She is 
33, an accountant and one of the booming number of older, first-time mothers. 
"I think I'm like a lot of women," she says. "We've already worked for a long 
time, and when we're pregnant we think, 'There's no way I'm going to be able to 
stay home all the time. I need someone to help.' " 
</P>
<P>
Going back to work, however, is not so easy. "This little baby comes into your 
life and you can't bear the thought of leaving him," Cooper says. "I went 
through a lot of feeling guilty and weighing it out. Should I or shouldn't I? 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up, our moms spent a lot of time with kids, not just at home but 
around events at school and church, and that's the kind of environment, with 
Mom in the picture, that surrounded us. Now, to pursue our own needs, we're 
subjecting our children to an experiment." 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes focus on something in the distance and show that she is wrestling with 
the imagined implications of what she has said. She blurts out the bottom line: 
"What choice do I have?" she says. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that she can count on Perez, hired as a housekeeper when Cooper was 
pregnant with Michael, helps quell Cooper's fears. If putting the baby in 
outside day care were the only affordable option, Cooper says, the decision to 
go back to work would have been even harder. 
</P>
<P>
Her face relaxes again. Through the floor-to-ceiling window, which is steaming 
up now as the air cools outside, Perez and Michael pose in gentle play among 
bright yard furniture. Perez offers a sweater that the boy rejects with wide 
shakes of his head. But a few moments later, he is snugly buttoned into his 
cardigan, standing on a bench, trying to braid Perez's hair. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper tilts her own blond head onto the back of the sofa, her full body and 
clear-cut features a languid American echo of the art on the wall above. There, 
a South Seas womanstares out of the frame, quiet but regal, mistress of the 
stretch of tropical sand where she kneels at rest. 
</P>
<P>
AT ANOTHER TIME, PEREZ is standing stiffly before the same couch, resisting all 
entreaties to sit down. She has been talking as she cleaned house and minded 
the boy about her native El Salvador, about her brother who was killed there 
two years ago "by gunshots from unknown men in civilian clothes," a sort of 
code phrase for murder by death squad. She has changed into a clean white dress 
for the two-hour bus trip back to her home in East Los Angeles. Michael is 
playing quietly on the carpet with a toy car, Cooper is late coming home and 
Perez is too anxious to sit. A wet stain appears at her breasts, then spreads 
quickly over the front of her dress. She has her own baby at home, a 
12-week-old boy she last nursed when it was still dark this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 33, remarried when she came to Los Angeles. She and her husband, another 
Salvadoran refugee, have another little boy, Roger, now 6. Like Cooper, Perez 
wrestles with questions about separation from her children, including three she 
left behind in El Salvador. She worries especially about the oldest, now 17, 
who must leave the protection of relatives and look for work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sad because she is there, but how can I send for her?" she says. "It's 
difficult to come the way I came -- the way she would have to come -- walking 
for hours, without shoes because the kind of shoes we bring break early in the 
trip. Night marches. Men who abuse the young girls on the way. It makes me too 
afraid to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon, Perez's sister, Lineth, who works as a part-time housekeeper in 
several Anglo homes, surprises Perez by dropping by to pick her up. Perez is 
excited because the ride home means that she will save enough time to see Roger 
while it is still light outside. Except on weekends, she usually only sees him 
by the light of a lamp. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters consider their lives success stories. They have made their way out 
of a caldron of war and dead ends at home. They work steadily for people they 
like, making three to four times the weekly salaries they earned when they 
first arrived in this country, and they are safer from la migra -- the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service -- than they might be in a factory or 
picking crops. Their coveted jobs do come with a price, however, paid by the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
"I get home at night and Roger is sleepy," Perez says. "Then I get up early 
again and have to leave. I look in at him quietly before I go, but sometimes 
that wakes him up and he says, 'Don't go to work.' I tell him, 'Look, little 
papa, we are lucky I have the job.' But it's hard for him to understand." 
</P>
<P>
GO TO ANY WESTSIDE PARK, to toddler story times at the Santa Monica public 
libraries or to infant exercise classes in Pacific Palisades, and you'll see 
them: Spanish-speaking women wheeling their Anglo charges. Wealthy Americans 
have long enjoyed live-in or daily help raising their children. What's new 
today -- and especially visible in certain areas of Los Angeles -- is how 
widespread the custom is becoming among families who don't consider themselves 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
Now more than half of U.S. women with children under age 3 work outside the 
home. For most, in-home child care is preferable but unaffordable. For those 
who can afford it, it may be more available in Southern California than 
anywhere else in the country -- the demand here has coincided with the arrival 
of tens of thousands of refugees and immigrants from Central America. Like 
Marta Perez, the women among them will do domestic work for wages a Sally 
Cooper can afford -- $150 will buy a 24-hour-a-day live-in baby sitter and 
housekeeper for a six-day week in the L.A. area, although women with excellent 
English, work documents and a driver's license might command as much as $300. 
</P>
<P>
No hard data is available on the new child-care workers and their employers, 
and without it, academics, government agencies, even labor organizers won't 
venture estimates of their numbers. Ruth E. Zambrana of the UCLA School of 
Social Welfare, an expert on immigrant women and health, offered a thumbnail 
sketch of the bigger picture, citing "impressions and observations, not 
empirical evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The use of of Latina nannies is increasing with the increase in working 
mothers, Zambrana observes. Once, Latina baby sitters in Southern California 
were typically from Mexico, but a shift began in the early 1980s. "Right now in 
Los Angeles," Zambrana says, "we have a dramatically changed scene -- the women 
are coming from El Salvador and Guatemala too." They fall into two groups: 
single women leaving war-ravaged countries for better opportunities and a 
"significant," perhaps higher, number of married women desperate to make enough 
money to send home to their own children. Employers are generally families in 
which both husband and wife have careers. The low wages have also made nannies 
available to a broad group of single-income families -- not just the very 
well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
For all their visibility, however, these arrangements are part of an officially 
invisible underground economy. Although the Anglos interviewed for this story 
are the kind of people unlikely to even run a red light, they know or suspect 
that their employees, for the most part, are here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 2-year-old Immigration Reform and Control Act, anyone who knowingly 
hires an immigrant without proper papers could be fined up to $10,000 and even 
go to jail for up to six months. Although a Texas couple was fined $350 in a 
rare case involving a housekeeper, no such cases have been brought in the L.A. 
area, says John Belluardo, a spokesman for the INS Western Region. "Enforcement 
focuses primarily on corporate employers," he says, adding, "That is not to 
send a signal to individuals that they are free to hire illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
It is a picture that demolishes the Mary Poppins image. The nannies have no 
safety net, no benefits or Social Security. There is enormous turnover among 
all day-care workers, probably because the economic incentive to stay isn't 
there, and Latina nannies are no exception. Madeline Stoner, an assistant 
professor of social welfare at USC and an expert on the history of child care, 
says, "This is not a position our society values by making it well paid." 
</P>
<P>
Church and community workers sometimes play matchmaker between new immigrants 
and families. Some agencies in Los Angeles specialize in placing such care 
givers. They require a document such as a green card to prove a job applicant 
is here legally, but, as one agency owner admitted ruefully, she has no way of 
proving that the documents are authentic. At any rate, it is not the agencies 
that are answering the demand. Much more typical are informal matches. When 
Marta Perez arrived, for instance, she paid a Guatemalan woman in her 
neighborhood $50 to find her a first job; by now, Perez figures that she 
herself has placed seven Guatemalans and Salvadorans, at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Kramer, another Anglo mother, who lives in Pacific Palisades, describes 
the underground network: "No one I know has to look more than two weeks (for 
help). You just put the word out and it's there." 
</P>
<P>
IN KRAMER'S NEIGHBORHOOD, homes look so much like the American dream that 
owners rent them out for TV commercials. Donna Kramer, who is married to an 
attorney and doesn't work outside the home, is kept as busy managing her 
household as the mistress of a medieval manor might have been. Last year she 
hired Esperanza Flores, who is Salvadoran, to clean house and take care of 
Marissa, 5, and Garr, 8. In some ways it was a match made in heaven, even if 
neither Kramer nor Flores might have predicted it a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer says when she and her best friend, Vera, used to talk about having 
someone in the home, they decided "it just didn't sound like it would be a 
comfortable situation. I remember we'd say, 'I just can't imagine somebody else 
doing all the little things. It would be like losing a kind of freedom in your 
own house.' We sort of both laugh now because Vera has someone living in and so 
do I." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the Latin American women who care for children in Los Angeles 
homes, Flores is expected to do housework too. Kramer is not the kind of 
employer who compulsively cleans a room before the housekeeper gets to it, nor 
does she speak in terms of guilt. "I never feel like I am neglecting my 
children," she says. "I just need to be out, and I have a live-in because I 
want to leave them with someone I trust. Also, I don't get any great pleasure 
out of cleaning my house." 
</P>
<P>
Flores, meanwhile, says she is finally earning enough to send $150 "every 20 
days" to her children in San Salvador. As she sits at the mahogany dinette off 
the spotless kitchen, Marissa's arms slung around her neck, it's hard to 
picture Flores at home on the southeast edge of that capital. That neighborhood 
has unpaved streets and no bus service, and after a good rain it is common to 
hear that a house has slipped down the sides of the huge ravine. Because an 
army garrison is nearby, Flores says, she and her neighbors lived in fear, 
"from one minute to the next," that their teen-age sons might be forced into 
conscription. At night, inevitably, silence is torn by bursts of automatic 
weapons fire. 
</P>
<P>
In San Salvador, Flores -- whose husband deserted her -- ran a small store out 
of her house and supported her boys and a daughter, now 14, "over a period of 
16 years when I wasn't apart from my children even one night." The war hung on 
and sharpened. Finally, when the place was robbed, she couldn't get help from 
authorities, who blamed guerrillas. "It was a lie," she says, but to contradict 
the police was to bring suspicion on her own head. Flores doesn't entertain the 
question of whether she is an economic, war or political refugee. "I am here to 
earn enough to feed the children at home, to help my girl out of there and to 
pay for my boys to study and prepare themselves," she says. "How long will it 
take? I don't know. But this is the way I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Even the most apparently symbiotic relationship has trouble spots. It rattles 
Kramer that her desire to treat Flores as a member of the family clashes 
agonizingly with her need to tell her what to do -- a typical problem of women 
who are employing servants for the first time. Kramer is especially distressed 
today because the weekend is approaching. Flores has Sundays off and has taken 
to asking on Saturday afternoons whether she might leave early to go to the 
room she rents near Hoover and Vermont. Replacing her for an evening with a 
local baby sitter is not an option. "The teen-agers up here don't need to 
work," Kramer laments. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Flores will feel bad about staying Saturday night, and whether 
Kramer will feel bad insisting that she does, goes to the heart of the 
relationship between the two women. They depend on each other and do not want 
to offend each other. Flores is part of the household, but she is not part of 
the family. She insists that she has her own family that "I never forget about 
for a moment." Kramer, meanwhile, wants Flores to feel "at home," which she 
isn't, and is embarrassed to admit that, with a busy life but no outside job 
and a live-in maid / baby sitter, she feels "decadent." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes young Garr seems to reflect his mother's confusion. One night Flores 
is playing a favorite game with the children. As she chases them with a mop, 
they jump out of her way or hide, giggling when she pretends she can't reach 
them. Playing hard, Garr smashes his fingers in a door and screams in pain to 
his mother upstairs. Flores is devastated, yet through his tears Garr wants 
before all else to defend her.. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't her fault," he sobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell her," encourages Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
"I will in a minute," he agrees, his cries mellowing to a whimper. "Right now 
my finger hurts." 
</P>
<P>
But the next morning, Garr lashes out in anger because Kramer is leaving. 
Flores tries to comfort him and divert his attention. Garr looks at her and 
screams, "I don't want you," and other things that Kramer won't repeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard him talk to anyone like that before," Kramer says. "Maybe he 
thought it was OK because she can't understand English." 
</P>
<P>
AT NIGHT IN HER ROOM DOWNSTAIRS, Flores studies two books Kramer bought for 
her. One is a Dr. Seuss dictionary in Spanish and English, with bold color 
pictures of objects such as "hen" and "boat." The other is "Home Maid Spanish." 
It was written in the 1960s, which dates it for its new market; the holidays 
section, for instance, lists only Mexican national days. It contains 
multiple-choice phrases such as "Please furnish / I will furnish your 
uniforms," which employers like Sally Cooper and Kramer, who wouldn't think of 
demanding uniforms, find quaint. The bilingual commands are listed by job, such 
as "Living room: Wax and polish the piano, but do not wax the keys." 
</P>
<P>
"Me want juice," is the way Garr talks to Flores, and louder than necessary. 
Why? "I have to talk patchy or she won't understand." His words have the 
faintest, almost imperceptible, tone of resentment. 
</P>
<P>
Women like Kramer say they would like to talk more deeply to the women who work 
for them but they can't. "Most of my friends, like me, hired through word of 
mouth. We depend on the recommendations of each other's housekeepers who always 
have friends or sisters looking for work," she says. "Then, like I'm doing with 
Esperanza, we trust our own intuitions day by day. You don't have much choice, 
really, if you don't speak their language." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer concedes that she doesn't know much about what Flores does on her off 
hours. "I don't know what values she taught her own children, although I assume 
that because she is a nice person she lives by the same values we do." 
</P>
<P>
Talking it over one afternoon, the question of what impact Flores will have on 
the values and outlook of Marissa and Garr seems to concern her deeply. But 
finally, Kramer insists that the question doesn't matter. It is from the 
family, she says, that the children will learn the important principles of 
life. In this view -- and it is the dominant one -- the care giver falls into 
the same category as a costly board game or good book. "The nanny is there to 
enhance the environment of the child while the parent is gone, that's all," 
Kramer concludes. 
</P>
<P>
One morning when Kramer is gone, Flores sits at the dinette while Marissa 
orbits her like a little moon. 
</P>
<P>
"She speaks English fine," offers Marissa, anxious to join the conversation, 
which is going on in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"Que galan," says Flores. How nice that would be. They laugh together. 
</P>
<P>
At the refrigerator Flores offers fruit juice, which Marissa rejects. ("You 
know your mother doesn't want you to have the Fudgsicles until after lunch.") 
Flores sits again. Her head is framed by the white eyelet curtains on the 
window behind her, which gives onto the front walk, mauve and pink roses beyond 
the beveled glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I see the war here on television," she says. "It makes you want to 
be there now." Then she smiles at what she said. "As if you could protect your 
children anyway." 
</P>
<P>
If they could talk to each other, as both say they want to, Kramer and Flores 
might find that they have much in common -- from their trust in intuition to 
their worries about their children. They might also be able to come up with a 
plan to, well, handle Marissa, who is now removing a Fudgsicle from the freezer 
compartment herself. Brazenly, she sits at the table, slurping at the 
chocolate. Kramer has a frustrated mother's description of her daughter: 
"Affectionate, obstinate, belligerent and intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
"Some days it feels I just yell at her all day long," Kramer says. "I worry 
Esperanza might wonder, 'Why is this mother yelling?' And I have no way of 
saying to her, 'She drives me crazy.' Do you think she understands that?" 
</P>
<P>
Marissa has hit Flores to get her attention, but Flores won't report it; she is 
afraid of getting fired. While Kramer is crying out in her mind for someone to 
sympathize with her, to understand that Marissa is willful, Flores of all 
people knows it best, but keeps it a secret. 
</P>
<P>
"Not every parent understands that if one complains it doesn't mean one doesn't 
like her child," she says. In fact, she has seen that kind of misunderstanding 
arise and watched jobs evaporate for her friends. "Besides, when you do 
complain, the child can begin to think of you as the enemy." She tenderly dabs 
with a napkin at the chocolate tracks on Marissa's face as the girl climbs into 
her lap. There, lulled by the cadence of Flores' foreign speech, the child 
falls asleep. 
</P>
<P>
BY THE TIME MARISSA, Garr and little Michael Cooper are parents, the face of 
this region will look different than it does today. According to a 1988 Census 
Bureau report, since 1980 the Latino population of the United States has 
increased five times faster than that of any other group, reaching an estimated 
19.4 million. California counts the highest per-state Latino population -- 6.6 
million. One projection, by David Hayes-Bautista, director of the Chicano 
Studies Center at UCLA -- assuming an influx of immigrants from a troubled 
southern hemisphere and continued high fertility rates among the Latin 
population -- suggests that Latinos could make up as much as 45% of the state's 
population by 2030, outstripping Anglos, Asians and blacks. Already, in Los 
Angeles, Anglos make up less than half the population. About 60% of the 
half-million children in the city's public schools are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Parents like the Coopers and the Kramers not only are aware of this picture, 
but also say they want to help their children prepare for the new realities. 
They say they like having a Spanish-speaking care giver precisely because she 
might help their children become bilingual. "Learning Spanish at home would be 
so much easier for him than at school," Cooper says. "At this age the 
children's minds are sponges." 
</P>
<P>
Like other elements in this experiment, however, the hoped-for process of 
cultural exchange may have results that are neither uniform nor predictable. 
</P>
<P>
Even Anglo children who are surrounded by Latinos may develop strong ideas 
early about what language belongs to whom. Take Joshua, the 3 1/2-year-old son 
of Chris Delaney, an editor, and his art-director wife, Carol. Josh goes to a 
bilingual preschool, then comes home to his infant sister and an obviously 
beloved Guatemalan woman named Raquel -- Josh calls her Raki. One night Chris, 
who is teaching himself Spanish, sits on the bed with Josh for their bedtime 
reading. "Uno, dos, tres," Chris offers, counting apples on a page. Josh draws 
himself up sharply. "Don't talk that way," the boy says. "That Raki talk." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Cooper says she does not think Michael will grow up "thinking of Spanish 
as a second language, but meaning second class," even though the only person 
speaking Spanish to him works for Mom and Dad. "I hope not," she says. At the 
nursery school she has chosen, Michael won't hear Spanish or see Latino 
children. "Maybe a few Asian, but that's about it. It's pretty much kids like 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
In neighborhoods that have a broad mix of residents, public schools can become 
places where children of many backgrounds are thrown together and prejudices 
can break down early. But youngsters from homes like the ones in this story 
(arguably the kind of homes likely to produce a significant proportion of 
tomorrow's decision makers) are liable to be isolated from the realities of 
demographic change because they don't go to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer and her neighbor, Lori Tyler, who employs a Mexican nanny, both say they 
want their children to learn Spanish to be able to better understand the new 
California. Yet they send their children to private schools because they feel 
that "standards" have suffered at the local public school because it makes 
special efforts to accommodate bused-in Latino students with language and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
And no matter how close the children become to the women who take care of them, 
two-way sharing of values may be limited because the nannies are obviously 
servants. The children learn this lesson young. Michael Cooper observes day 
after day that his mother might sit down when Perez is in the room, but Perez 
doesn't sit down in front of his mother. He sees Perez take home old newspapers 
once a week and, with permission, other items the family would discard. One 
day, he claimed the dollars in play from his mother's pocket, then, 30 inches 
tall, marched over importantly to pay Perez her wages. 
</P>
<P>
John, Tyler's generally sweet and respectful 12-year-old, recently looked at 
his mother in frustration and disbelief when she told him to pick up his messy 
room. "Why?" he said. "We have a housekeeper." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's here to pick up after you," Tyler quickly told him, but in fact Latin 
women have been doing just that since he was a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
USC's Stoner speculates that the cultural meeting between Latina nannies and 
Anglo families may not generate deep mutual understanding. "There is no 
empirical evidence anywhere in history that any kind of cultural transmission 
in fact takes place in these situations." The nannies and their charges, Stoner 
says, probably will not come to share values just because they spend time 
together. "Think about Scarlett O'Hara," she muses. "She never lost her racism 
despite the love she had for her mammy." 
</P>
<P>
THE EMPLOYERS TEND TO call the women they hire "nannies" or "housekeepers," 
even when their main task is child care. Often the women who do the work sound 
less grand when they refer to themselves: Baby sitter is the word they 
routinely use, spoken in English in the midst of a Spanish conversation -- 
there is no precise Spanish equivalent. The other common word they use is 
muchacha, which means "girl" but connotes "servant." 
</P>
<P>
Lori Tyler would never call Dolores Garcia a "servant." This week she is urging 
her to get a driver's license. "I seem to have to be in three places at the 
same time all the time, which is really why I desperately need somebody who can 
drive," says Tyler, who recently gave up grammar school teaching to pursue a 
career in acting and producing. But it is also out of fear for Garcia. Tyler's 
worst nightmare: "Dolores is picked up by immigration police at a bus stop." 
</P>
<P>
The Tyler house is noisy today. In front of an oak vanity with an oval mirror, 
Garcia is singing "It's a Small World" in a heavy accent as she braids 
8-year-old Alexandra's honey-colored hair. Workmen shout, laying flagstones for 
a new patio, while others are digging a pool. John runs out the door with a 
friend. If it were a weekday, his mother would be chauffeuring him to one of 
his scheduled activities: soccer, tennis lessons, religious school, piano 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they realize that not everyone is as privileged as they are," Tyler 
says, sitting before glass doors overlooking a canyon. "It bothers me that they 
are surrounded by a lot of kids whose families are much more wealthy than we 
are. What they are seeing in their everyday lives is just not the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Tyler wants her children to be bilingual and tells Garcia to speak to them in 
Spanish so they'll learn. But Garcia has her own agenda. "Someday I will go 
home and work in an artesania shop for tourists," she says. She will get the 
job, she hopes, on the strength of the English she learns here. "The children 
teach me."

Newcomers from Mexico take jobs in child care, but because they have been 
coming to work in the United States for at least 40 years, their networks are 
better established than those of the Central Americans, and they often can find 
better-paying work. Garcia would not suffer as some other immigrants might if 
she went home to Mexico, because she comes from a stable, lower-middle-class 
background. It is only by leaving, however, that she has been able to push the 
family ahead. At home she made about $60 a month as a grammar school teacher. 
Today, alone at 24, she is putting two younger brothers through school; she 
also "modernized" her parents' house. Yet Garcia doesn't dare tell her mother 
and father exactly how she makes her money. "Once I mentioned it to one of my 
sisters. I made her swear to keep it a secret that I was cleaning houses and 
taking care of children. 'Oh no!' she said."

In Oaxaca, the southern state that Garcia is from, poor young Indian girls are 
sent from their villages to work in homes in the richer provincial capitals or 
Mexico City, and the racial and social stigma attached to the job there is real 
and deep. But Garcia has converted the same job here into a kind of finishing 
school that will set her apart from -- above -- her neighbors back home. "I'm 
doing all this on my own," she says, in a tone that speaks adventure. "I'm 
learning what it is to control my own life and go forward. I haven't made any 
big mistakes yet."

Tyler hired Garcia last year "on intuition" for a $500 fee through a broker who 
advertises in a local newspaper, to replace a Nicaraguan woman who worked for 
the Tylers for four years, and a Salvadoran who worked two years before that. 
The presence of women from a vastly different world, Tyler hopes, is an object 
lesson for John and Alexandra. 
</P>

"It's definitely positive for my children to see how someone like Dolores has 
to leave her family to help them and send home her money instead of spending it 
on what she wants," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler would like John and Alexandra to grow up with compassion for the women 
who once changed their diapers and now care for them in other ways. She admits 
that the children don't know other Latinos socially and that neither does she, 
except for her own childhood nanny from Guadalajara, a woman she still 
affectionately calls her "second mother." Yet she also appears horrified at the 
thought of her children coming to identify Latinos as a servant class. 
</P>
<P>
She tries to fight the image, but her only weapons are words, and they do not 
seem enough. "When we've returned back from our trips to Spain or Mexico, I 
tell the children those countries are just like the United States, in that you 
have very rich people and very poor people and a middle class. I tell them 
there are all kinds of people there, just like there are all kinds of 
Americans. A lot of people in those countries have housekeepers, too."

IF THE RELATIONSHIPS described here are marked by warmth, dependence and, 
sometimes, strain, they are also marked by change, which would become clear in 
subsequent weeks. In autumn, Sally Cooper was all smiles about Marta Perez, but 
by late fall, she seems impatient. Perez has been acting "strangely," she says, 
missing housecleaning jobs that Cooper set up with friends because Perez wanted 
the extra money. Perez doesn't call to cancel, which puts Cooper in a tough 
spot, and she seems distracted. "I think she came back to work too soon after 
her baby," Cooper says, sounding sympathetic and annoyed at the same time.

In recent weeks, Dolores Garcia, who now has a boyfriend here and wants to 
extend her stay, has managed to qualify for legal papers by passing as a 
farmhand under the immigration law. "She paid someone $500 and has to go work 
in the fields near Santa Maria for 90 days," Lori Tyler says. "I don't know 
what we'll do without her, but she said she'll be back, and she'll be safer 
then."

Donna Kramer leaves town for two days with her husband, visiting some property 
they own. While they are gone, Flores says she is in charge. What she doesn't 
know is that by January, Kramer will have demoted her to a visiting housekeeper 
and hired a Danish au pair, declaring that the language barrier frustrated and 
finally overwhelmed her. It was a fragile marriage, after all. 
</P>
<P>
One morning over the holidays, however, Marissa was clinging to Flores' legs 
affectionately, making it awkward for either one of them to walk, but neither 
seemed to care. Flores looked tired.

"Last night I dreamed I went back to El Salvador and my children wouldn't pay 
any attention to me," she confides. "I woke up crying and went to sleep again 
just when it was getting light. Then I dreamed they died and no one could find 
me to tell me about it."

From inside the TV room, hung with thick shades to shut out the light for 
daytime viewing, Garr calls out for "somebody!" to join him. He is watching a 
video in which a family, bundled in bright wool and watch caps, ski across the 
screen together, skimming snow so smooth and trackless it looks as if no one 
has ever been there before.
