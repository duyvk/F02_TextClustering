A consortium of seven Japanese companies has won a contract worth an
estimated Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m) to Dollars 600m to supply equipment for
a new steel production facility at the Baoshan complex, near Shanghai.
The Japanese group, headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi
Corporation, signed a contract at the weekend, despite a long history of
problems at the plant, touted as China's largest industrial project when
conceived two decades ago.
Members of the consortium say they have been told by the Chinese partner not
to release details of the contract, but the companies will supply equipment
for a hot-rolled steel sheet facility capable of producing 2.8m tonnes a
year.
The Baoshan complex produced 6.3m tonnes of steel last year, and is expected
to increase its output to 10m tonnes by 2000, as part of a national plan to
lift steel production from 80m tonnes last year to 100m tonnes by the
century's end. Chinese steel producers have been unable to meet demand over
the past two years of rapid growth.
