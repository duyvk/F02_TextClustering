After spending most of her career in German roles, Anja Silja has found a
new lease of life portraying the mature female monsters of Janacek's operas.
First came Kostelnicka in Jenufa at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden. Now she
is focusing on the grandest and most pathetic of them all - Emilia Marty in
The Makropoulos Case, which she has just sung in Vienna and will repeat at
Glyndebourne in 1995. Her stage magnetism is perfectly suited to this opera,
so much so that the new production at the Volksoper turns out to be even
more of a one-woman show than usual.
Anyone looking for a summation of all Janacek's previous female portraits -
which is how some commentators view the heroine of Makropoulos - will be
disappointed, for Silja avoids extremes of pathos or the grotesque. Instead,
we get a distillation of the histrionic skills which have made her such a
charismatic singing actress these past 30 years: the erotic power of a Lulu,
the scheming calculation of an Ortrud, the self-destructive passion of
Elektra.
If that sounds more than a touch Germanic, it suits the expressionist style
of this German-language production. The character is established before she
sings a note. The wide-rimmed black hat and fur coat announce a grande dame,
the flowing red wig reeks of temperament and the leather trousers suggest
this fictional 337-year old is real and young at heart. With her tall, slim
figure, Silja carries it off in style, her stage manner a mixture of
purposeful stillness and dynamic gestures. Small wonder everything around
her pales into insignificance.
Act two produces some authentic diva behaviour, and after the subsequent
humiliations - all graphically realised - she sings the closing monologue
from the front of the orchestra pit, dressed in nothing more than a long
black underskirt. What saves it from melodrama is the giant conviction she
invests in every word. The voice is still strong, if not perfectly steady,
and she is more than a match for Janacek's terse declamatory lines.
She deserves better support from her production team. Under Isaac
Karabtchevsky, the Volksoper orchestra was poorly balanced and slack. The
staging devised by Christine Mielitz and her designer Reinhard Heinrich
looked like a bad night at the Komische Oper in Berlin, where both are
based.
The decor was skimpy and poorly lit, consisting of little more than
interchangeable blocks and ill-defined projections. There was too much
movement, much of it needlessly brutalist. As a result, the Volksoper
ensemble made little impact. Kurt Schreibmayer turned Gregor into an ardent
wooer, Wicus Slabbert made an unusually sinister Prus and Ernst-Dieter
Suttheimer's Hauk was a beautifully eccentric sketch.
Discounting visits by Czech companies from Brno and Prague, this is the
first staging of The Makropoulos Case in Vienna. Broucek, Vixen and House of
the Dead have already been given at the Volksoper. Jenufa and Katya Kabanova
are in the Staatsoper's repertory, and Osud was given a concert performance
last year. But judging by this production, the Viennese approach to Janacek
is still somewhat cavalier. Thanks to Anja Silja alone, Volksoper audiences
have seen what Makropoulos is really about.
