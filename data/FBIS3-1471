  [Text] Johannesburg March 28 SAPA -- Zulu marchers were 
picked off and then attacked en masse by snipers in surrounding 
buildings as they sat listening to their leaders in 
Johannesburg's Library Gardens on Monday afternoon, according to 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] Transvaal organiser Themba Khoza. 
"The attacks were well-calculated, planned assassinations," Mr 
Khoza told a press conference at the Inkatha Freedom Party 
offices Monday night. 
  Questioning the role of the security forces in the 
afternoon's mayhem, he said the IFP had received information on 
Sunday evening that the African National Congress (ANC) meant to 
attack the march and he had personally passed this on to the SA 
Defence Force and the police. They had telephoned the IFP on 
Monday morning to confirm this was true but it was too late to 
stop the march even if he had wanted to, said Mr Khoza. 
  The trouble allegedly started as the march -- about 10,000 
Zulus massed in support of King Goodwill Zwelithini and his 
demand for Zulu sovereignty -- moved past ANC headquarters. 
"They sniped at us from the building. One of our leaders was 
killed on the spot and others were seriously hurt," said Mr 
Khoza. 
  Later when the marchers were gathered in Library Gardens "a 
hail of bullets came down from the buildings". 
  According to police and press reports, it now appears that 
up 
to 18 people were killed during, before and in the ensuing chaos 
which followed this incident. 
  Mr Khoza said the question was why the security forces, 
already warned by the information passed on to them by the IFP, 
had not prevented the sniping. "And if that is not enough 
several of our people were also shot and killed by the police." 
  The people who had been killed were the same who the 
Goldstone Commission had accused him of supplying with arms, Mr 
Khoza noted. "Nothing has been said about the ANC and their 
caches. No amount of killing will fade our hearts. It is 
freedom we are committed to...the struggle continues. But at 
the end of the day we are left with bitterness and stress and a 
wish that it does not happen again, not to anyone."
