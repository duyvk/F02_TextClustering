NORTHWEST VALLEY CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Manny Alvarado, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 22-7; 1st in league at 12-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Kennedy won its third City Section 4-A Division title of the 
decade last season behind a group of talented seniors. The band included City 
MVP Gino Tagliaferri, All-Valley infielder Mike Murray and three-year starter 
Pat DeBoer. Yet, even with those standouts in the lineup, All-City junior 
Garret Anderson batted cleanup -- and did he mop up statistically. Anderson, 
who bats left-handed and plays in the outfield, hit .362 with five home runs 
and 31 runs batted in. He led area juniors in RBIs in City play. Anderson is 
not the lone threat, however. Catcher Lazaro Campos, who hit .367, is back for 
his third season of varsity play and will bat cleanup behind Anderson. Troy 
Bourne, a reserve last year, will start at first. James Bernas, an all-league 
member of the junior varsity, will start at second. Either Billy Ramirez or 
Rich Trujillo will fill Tagliaferri's slot at short. Palmer Drain, used as a 
designated-hitter last year, starts at third. Ben Guzman, Jason Rosen, Mitchell 
Drain and Birmingham transfer Jack Moussa (.266, nine RBIs) are in a fight for 
the remaining outfield berths. The pitching corps has been through it all 
before. Left-hander Denny Sharp (7-2, 3.75 earned-run average, 108 strikeouts 
in 84 innings) might possess the best curveball in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Cody Beaumaster (4-1, 2.13 ERA) is the No. 2 starter. 
However, Sharp (67 walks) and Beaumaster (15 walks in 19 2/3 innings) will need 
better control if the Golden Cougars want to make it two titles in a row. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Last year at this time pitching was our big question mark," Alvarado 
said. "Now that seems to be one of our strengths." Last year's strength was the 
infield. That also has changed. "It's one of the strongest outfield teams I've 
ever been associated with," Alvarado said. "As long as we can catch it and 
throw it, we'll be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Marden, 14th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-7-1; 2nd in league at 10-5-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: If San Fernando makes a run at Kennedy for the league title, 
it will be behind the strength of its pitching staff. John Najar, a utility 
player last season as a junior, has been converted into a pitcher and Marden is 
pleased with what he sees. "He could be the most dominant pitcher I've seen all 
winter," Marden said. Hector De La Cruz, a three-year letterman, returns for 
his senior year. De La Cruz (6-1, 3.42 ERA, 58 strikeouts in 58 1/3 innings), a 
left-hander, included among his victories an upset of Chatsworth on the road. 
Left-hander Canto Franco, the junior varsity league MVP last year, and 
sophomore right-hander Rick Savala are also in the running for a place in the 
rotation. "With a lefty and righty in the starting rotation and a lefty and 
righty in the bullpen, we look real strong with our pitching," Marden said. Two 
starting position players return: third baseman Richard (Shorty) Sanchez and 
outfielder Octavio Serrano. Fernando Ortega and Roy Aguilera, reserves last 
year, are among a large group fighting for outfield berths. Marden's biggest 
discovery could be shortstop Luis Rodriguez, a switch-hitting sophomore. 
Rodriguez follows in the footsteps of All-City shortstops Bobby Corrales (1989) 
and Albert Torrez (1988). "He's going to be better than both of them before 
he's through," Marden predicted. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The 1990 Tigers are similar to their predecessors in almost every 
respect, Marden said, and status quo is fine with him. "The key for us is to do 
what we do well -- put the ball in play, have solid pitching and play good 
defense," Marden said. "We play for one run an inning." Where do they rate? "We 
may not be as strong as some teams we've had in terms of returning starters," 
he said. "But nobody else does, either, except maybe for El Camino (Real)." 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Darryl Stroh, 21st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-16; 4th in league at 1-15 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Last season, Stroh's 20th as coach, was the worst in his 
tenure, a career that includes five 4-A City titles. Are his players intent on 
proving that 1989 was a fluke? Stroh says he doesn't know, and for good reason. 
"We haven't spent any time talking about last year," he said. Based on the 
early returns, '89 might have been an anomaly. The Highlanders won seven of 
eight games in winter-league play, Stroh said, and have been opening some eyes 
-- namely his own. "I've been pleasantly surprised," he said. Right-hander Gabe 
Miller returns as does left-hander Mike Komsky. Another familiar face will 
brace the pitching staff -- football quarterback Bryan Martin. The younger 
brothers of two former Highlander standouts will play at first. Josh Leach, 
whose brother Jeremy played football and baseball, will see time at first along 
with Robert Fowble, whose brother Greg also was a two-sport player. Second base 
will be manned by either Todd Williams or Darryl Stroh Jr. Shortstop Jon 
Condos, a returning starter, "has looked outstanding," Stroh said. Gabe Padilla 
or Derrick Cole will start at third. The outfield likely will consist of 
Martin, Alex Vasquez and Eric Anderson. Scott Berger, the lone sophomore on the 
team, also might play in the outfield. Andy Petroski, a kicker on the football 
team, is the catcher. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Stroh says the team strength is undeniably its defense, "but it'll all 
boil down to the pitching," he said. The team's superlative performance in 
winter ball has left Stroh guardedly optimistic. "We won seven of eight and we 
played well," he said, "but we won something like three out of four last year 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich Raymond, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-12-1; 3rd in league at 5-10-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: With the exception of returning All-City outfielder Pat 
Bryant, the Cavaliers' strength also appears to be on the pitching rubber. A 
pair of right-handers, Bobby Macias (5-11, 175) and Bobby McRae (6-5, 175), are 
the likely starters. McRae, who starts on the basketball team and will be a 
late arrival, was 2-5 with a 3.26 ERA last year. Sophomores Mike Petruzates, 
Robert Rundquist and Mario Macias, Bobby's brother, also will pitch. 
Right-hander Steve Pressler is a possible relief specialist. Petruzates and 
McRae will alternate at first when not pitching. Sophomore Julio Marcial will 
start at second and David Sipolla -- who batted a team-high .465 last year on 
the junior varsity -- will play shortstop. Mike Sutyak, a junior, is the third 
baseman. Macias and Petruzates are probable starters in the outfield. Bryant, a 
senior who will start in center and bat first, hit .464 and stole 21 bases last 
year. Both marks ranked first among returning area City players. He also drove 
in 14 runs and recorded team highs in doubles (five) and home runs (four). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Raymond coached the Cleveland junior varsity last year, so he is 
familiar with the many youngsters who populate the Cavs' roster. He knows their 
strengths, their limitations. "Our sophomores are highly skilled," he said. 
"Some have played for those world championship teams in Encino . . . but we're 
awful green and young." If the pitching comes through as expected and the 
defense holds up -- a couple of big ifs -- Cleveland might well knock off some 
of the 4-A title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley League 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Maio, 8th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-8; 3rd in league at 9-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: First things first. Maio wants everyone to be aware of one 
thing: "I'm trying very hard to keep American Legion and El Camino baseball 
separate." It might be a tall order. The Woodland Hills West Legion team won 
the World Series title in August, and the majority of its players were from El 
Camino Real. Included on the West team were Ryan McGuire (first base), Pat 
Treend (pitcher), Jason Cohen (left field), Bobby Kim (catcher), Jeff Marks 
(right field), Greg Lederman (third base), Chris Castillo (outfield), Gregg 
Sheren (infield), Chris Teich (infield) and Sean Boldt (pitcher). Of the group, 
five were regulars. And if that's not enough, Herman Merchan (utility), who 
excelled at St. Genevieve High and on the Panorama City Legion team, 
transferred to El Camino Real over the summer. Seeking places on the pitching 
staff are Corey Bromberg, Daniel Costa, Terry Morrow and Josh Massey. Maio's 
toughest sell? "I really believe that there are 15 teams in the Valley that can 
beat us. . . . The notoriety they received doesn't mean a thing now." Boldt, a 
junior transfer from Canyon, might be a key. McGuire, a hard-throwing 
left-hander, was effective during Legion play in late relief and would make an 
ideal closer. If Boldt falters, however, the UCLA-bound McGuire might be used 
in the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: This team has been tabbed by many -- including most of the coaches in 
the conference -- as the one to beat. Maio bristles at the thought. "Look at 
all the No. 1 teams who lose. Granada Hills in football, Chatsworth was ranked 
No. 1 in the nation (in baseball) by USA Today a couple of years ago and they 
didn't win it, USC lost to Northridge (in baseball)," he said. Are the players 
responding? "I think they're listening. I think I've made an impression." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Meusborn, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 21-7; 1st in league at 12-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: One of the most successful programs in the state, Chatsworth 
has won or shared nine consecutive league titles. The good news for Meusborn is 
that Chatsworth isn't favored to win the title this season. "It doesn't make 
that much difference to me," he said. "We're going to play them game to game, 
week to week. It won't make me happy to read that we're favored to win and it 
won't make me mad if we're not favored." Right-hander Reed McMackin, part of 
the Chancellors' starting rotation a year ago, returns after posting an 8-2 
record with a 4.02 ERA. Left-hander Danny Rodriguez, a standout on the junior 
varsity last year, is the probable No. 2 starter. Mitch Root, who will start in 
center field, will be the closer. Soly Maya (first base), Nestor Martinez 
(second), Tommy Lee (shortstop) and Adam Pearlman (third) all played for the 
junior varsity in 1989. Outfielder Rodney Bloom and catcher Mike Mancuso are 
returning lettermen. Scott Carpenter is scheduled to play in right. "When you 
look at the roster, you see we have 11 seniors," Meusborn said. "We're older 
than most teams, but experience-wise, we're sort of green." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I think we have some good pitching," Meusborn said. "With Rodriguez 
and McMackin, we'll be in pretty good shape." Chatsworth is strong up the 
middle with Mancuso, Martinez, Lee and Root. But there is a preponderance of 
new names. Derek Wallace, Eric Johnson, Jason Evans and Rich Aude -- all of 
whom were both drafted and received scholarship offers -- have graduated. 
Perhaps Meusborn will soon find out the true strength of the Chatsworth 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich McKeon, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-11; 2nd in league at 11-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: McKeon is left to sort through what remains of a 
senior-dominated team that a year ago gave Chatsworth a run for the league 
title. Returning starters include Benji Belfield, a shortstop-relief pitcher 
who had three saves and was 4-3 with a 4.94 ERA. Belfield also ranked among the 
team's offensive leaders with seven extra-base hits and 15 RBIs. Brett Reisner 
(.246, 10 RBIs) returns in the outfield. Jamie Zeichick, a reserve last season 
after having off-season shoulder surgery, will start in the outfield and bat 
fourth. The pitching staff is deep but untested. Battling for starting berths 
are senior left-hander Ryan Revel, sophomore left-hander Cory Jacobson, junior 
right-hander Eddie Soto and sophomore right-handers Sean Collins and Michael 
Krasner. Carey Wilbur, a varsity reserve last season as a junior, will start at 
catcher. Sophomore John Erganian will play first base, freshman Warren Stewart 
and sophomore Matt Allison are battling it out at second, and freshman Brandon 
Witkow and Krasner are doing likewise at third. Darnell Hendricks, a speedy 
junior, will start in right. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I'm hoping that we'll have a combination of leadership and youth," 
McKeon said. McKeon also might have to rely on team speed to manufacture runs 
if the offense falters, a possibility given the experience of the team. "We 
probably have the quickest outfield around," he said. "We may rely on team 
speed in the top of the order." The team has more pitching depth than in the 
past, but experience is nil. Only Belfield has pitched at the varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Smith, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league at 3-13 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Smith is frank about the Hunters' chances. "We've basically 
got no pitching," he said. Senior left-hander Doug Van Horn, ineligible last 
season, is the only player certain to see time on the mound. Ineligibility has 
ravaged the team. "We have 11, maybe 12 kids out," he said. "We lost five kids 
to grades." Mike Bruce, a returning starter, will catch. "He has a real good 
arm," Smith said, which makes Bruce a possible pitching candidate. Returning 
lettermen Curt Sazzman and Valentine Douglas are waging a war for the nod at 
shortstop; the loser will play elsewhere in the infield. Doug Kreider, a 
returning starter, will play at third. Mike Lewis returns in the outfield. Greg 
Hurst also will play in the outfield. Leo Roldan is a possible starter at 
second, and Scott Blemker and Van Horn are expected to split time at first. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "The only thing we did decent in winter league was field the ball," 
Smith said. "We faced some pretty weak pitching and didn't do too well against 
that." Prospects don't look good, but Smith remains upbeat. "We'll have fun," 
he said. "But I think it's going to be a long year." 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY PAC-8 CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
Mid-Valley League 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Wayne Sink, 26th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-12; 3rd in league at 6-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: A team of vast experience appropriately will play for Sink in 
his 26th and final campaign as head coach. Nine returnees, headed by 
outfielders Bob Bookatz and Danny Larson, will be counted on for power. Bookatz 
batted .420 as a junior. Larson led City players in triples with six. Also 
coming back is senior infielder Justin Bass, who batted .343 in '89. The list 
of veterans also includes catchers Seth Rosenzweig and Marc Feder, pitchers 
Josh Brown and Jason Mansfield, probable leadoff hitter Ruben Flores and 
infielder-pitcher Matt Mowry. "It's a good nucleus to work with," Sink said. 
Players up from the junior varsity who will play key roles include first 
baseman Mike Belasco, first baseman-pitcher Noah Kirshbaum, left fielder Mike 
Malki and outfielder Adam Kallen. Brown and Kirshbaum are the right-handed 
starting pitchers and Mansfield is the lone left-handed starting pitcher. Mawry 
should pitch some short relief. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Sink is open in evaluating his swan song. "What we have is 
experience," he said. "And the rest is up to them. They could have a great 
season if they're motivated. But I can't go out there and hit that curveball." 
The primary goal, Sink says, is the playoffs. But he would like to build from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Kevin Campbell, 5th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-11; 1st in league at 8-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Monroe begins this season with something most teams would 
love to have: a veteran pitcher. Sean Henson is a senior who ranked fourth 
among Valley-area City pitchers last season with a 2.08 earned-run average in 
64 innings. Henson also will play first base. Other returnees include shortstop 
and leadoff hitter John Langley, power-hitting outfielder Jeff Rubell and 
outfielder Jim Rose. Joining Henson in the rotation will be a pair of 
sophomores: Christian Ascencio, who doubles as a first baseman, and Adrian 
Loverich. "One of those two will have to be a starter," Campbell said. The rest 
of the lineup is solid. San Fernando transfer Mario Gonzalez is a junior left 
fielder with good speed. Seniors Fran Espinosa and Chad Majers will play second 
base and third base, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: With Henson, Monroe has a proven winner on the mound. "Obviously, 
right now the question would be who will be our No. 2 starter," Campbell said. 
Defensively, the coach likes what he sees. As far as run production, Campbell 
pegs that as a gray area. "We need to improve our offense," he said. "If we can 
get the ball in play, we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bill Gordon, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-10; 2nd in league at 7-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The biggest news so far during Gordon's short stay at Van 
Nuys is, unfortunately, bad: Returning all-league senior shortstop Lorenzo 
Morales suffered pulled ligaments in his arm and is wearing a cast. "Hopefully, 
he'll return in three to four weeks," Gordon said. "I say hopefully. He's our 
best kid." In the meantime, Gordon looks to other returnees for leadership. 
Junior third baseman Hector Alvarenga is a letterman who will play shortstop 
until Morales returns. Seniors Martin Ramos (first base) and Carlos Gonzalez 
(outfield) also will start. The rest of the team is dominated by juniors, 
especially the pitching. The top two starters are 11th-graders Tony Gonzalez 
and Jayme Jimenez, a pair of "junk-ballers," according to Gordon. Morales, when 
he returns, will relieve. Juniors David Gomez and Jesus Enciso join Gonzalez in 
the outfield. Rare seniors in the lineup include second baseman Carlos 
Gutierrez and catcher Marcos Espino. A positive note for Gordon has been the 
emergence of sophomore Patrick Alvarado, who "is looking really good" at third 
base, according to Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Gordon is cautiously optimistic. "We want to be in every game," he 
said. "But our primary goal is the playoffs." While Morales is gone, Gordon 
will miss him like a soldier pining for home. In the meantime, Gordon looks 
ahead with a bright eye. "We've got to at least let them know that they've been 
in a ballgame," he said. "We have the makings of a pretty darn good team." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Stone, 12th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-14; 4th in league at 1-14 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Stone is nearly positive that this year's team will fare 
better than last season's largely because of the emergence of steady -- albeit 
green -- pitching staff. A pair of sophomores -- Jesse Yeomans and Bebo 
Granello -- will start on the mound. Two football players -- Robert Reynoso and 
Mike McCarthy -- will provide relief. Reseda's run production will be aided by 
veterans, notably junior Louis Vanacore, who batted .460 to finish third in the 
Valley-area City batting race. He is joined by ex-football players Joe Tushnet, 
a shortstop-center fielder who will bat first and provide speed, and Tuti 
Rodriguez, a first baseman who will bat fourth. "I'm expecting those guys to be 
real solid .300 to .400 hitters," Stone said. The team's best player, according 
to Stone, is freshman David Barbares, a shortstop who won't join the team until 
he's academically eligible in 10 weeks. "He's gonna be a good one," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: One thing is for sure, according to Stone: "We're going to be a lot 
better than last year. Last year, we had no pitching. This year, we're in 
better shape. This year, we'll be there in the seventh inning." The big 
variable, the coach says, will be the Regents' run production. "It's a matter 
of offense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
East Valley League 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Gary Donatella, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 19-4; 1st in league at 14-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Sylmar lost three top pitchers from last season's City 
semifinalists but that shouldn't stop Donatella's team from again making noise. 
Leading the way is Joe Contreraz, a senior third baseman who batted .351 last 
season and was second among City area players in doubles with eight. Contreraz 
will team with junior pitcher-outfielder Dereck Orneles in the heart of the 
order. Orneles can run, swing the bat and pitch, according to Donatella. 
Joining Orneles on the mound will be junior James Encinas, the team's top 
pitcher. Seniors Gonzalo Hernandez and Danny Garcia also will pitch along with 
sophomore Jimmy Lemos. Leadoff hitter David Romero is a senior outfielder. 
UCLA-bound football player London Woodfin will provide power (he hit .343 last 
year) when he returns in early April from arthroscopic knee surgery. Shortstop 
Roberto Garcia is sure-handed. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Sylmar has the makings of another fine team. What this year's team 
lacks in quality pitching, Donatella said, it makes up for in quantity of 
reliable pitchers. "Pitching is the key," he said. Scoring runs should be 
little problem with Contreraz, Orneles and Woodfin. Said Donatella: "We're 
going to be around the top." 
</P>
<P>
Poly 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jerry Cord, 15th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-9; 3rd in league at 11-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Six returning lettermen join a group of talented young 
players, a mix that bodes well for the Parrots. Cord will look to senior 
right-hander David Giatti, whose strong junior season was cut short by arm 
trouble that still hounds him. In 46 innings, Giatti led Valley-area City 
pitchers with a 1.22 ERA. "He's been throwing," Cord said. "But who knows how 
he'll come back?" Joining Giatti in the rotation will be senior right-hander 
Eddie Castellanos, who doubles as a designated-hitter. "We're counting on those 
two to be mainstays," Cord said. Junior pitchers, including Rodrigo Dorame and 
Raul Torres, will get a chance to pitch. Other leading returnees are position 
players. Senior shortstop Gabe Chavez and junior outfielder Jonathan Campbell 
are powerful hitters. The top of the order includes second baseman Roy Lozano 
and leadoff hitter Will Molina, a center fielder. Much of the youth comes from 
the 1989 Encino Pony League World champions: sophomores Steve Chavez (catcher), 
Jesus Perez (outfielder) and Francisco Flores (first baseman). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Poly has a legitimate shot at the title, but much depends on Giatti's 
recovery. "We're not gonna make a lot of mistakes defensively," Cord said. "We 
can make contact and score runs. The pitching is the only question. Somebody 
has to step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Grant 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Lucero, 14th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-5; 2nd in league at 12-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Talk about youth: Grant has two returning lettermen, and one 
of them is still playing basketball. That leaves senior second baseman Steve 
Pelote as the team's lone returning starter when play gets under way. 
Accordingly, Pelote will be counted on for big things. He batted .368 and drove 
in 25 runs last season. The other returnee is pitcher Billy May, a reserve 
forward on the basketball team. Lucero's No. 1 pitcher will be junior 
right-hander Gary Rosoff. Junior soccer player Holvik Castro pitched well in 
last year's playoffs. More youth can be found in sophomore right-hander Tony 
Kuper, a transfer from Antelope Valley. The lineup is somewhat shrouded in 
mystery at this point. Senior catcher Steve Gordon, junior second baseman 
Brandon Long and junior outfielder Shane Williams figure to bid for attention. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The football and basketball teams already have won league titles, 
placing the onus on Lucero's group to follow suit. Lucero says that the goals 
are there -- "Obviously, we want to win the league title. We always shoot for 
that." -- but the bodies remain in question. "Having just two returners makes 
it difficult," he said. "It's not like the past where I could rely on a Rodney 
Beck or a Javier Delahoya. We're trying to find the right combinations. We're 
so young and so competitive. There's some enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Marty Biegel, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league at 3-13 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The first name Biegel mentions when discussing the team uad 
is senior shortstop Eric Martinez. "He's got All-City potential," he said. 
Biegel also praises No. 3 hitter and football star Mike Lewis. Two pieces of 
the puzzle will not report until after the basketball season: first baseman 
Harry Marks and leadoff hitter-center fielder Duane Braxton. "Duane's my table 
setter," Biegel said. "He's got great speed and he's a great defensive 
outfielder." Biegel's top two pitchers are right-handers Sammy Ciaramarilo and 
Craig White, a junior varsity basketball player. The outfield contains good 
fielders in Nelson Pichardo and Ozzie Collins. Second baseman Carlos Olmos, an 
Orel Hershiser lookalike, according to Biegel, along with infielders Adrian 
Padilla and Charlie Lee will see playing time. Three are vying for the 
catcher's job: Steve Macias, Livan Cartaya and Ivan Guillermo. Jose Ortiz also 
could squeeze in some playing time for Biegel. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We'll go as far as our pitching carries us," Biegel said. "We will 
score runs, that I know." And with Biegel, the ebullient New Yorker at the 
helm, there is no shortage of enthusiasm. "The kids have been absolutely 
beautiful in their accepting of a new guy on the block," he said. As for the 
league race? "We'll be competitive," the coach assured.

PLAYERS TO WATCH: For the first time, the Dons will have an on-campus baseball 
diamond. And despite having just one returning varsity player, Richard might 
have carved out a respectable team to play at the new facility too. "Whenever a 
new guy comes into a program, they always say it'll take a year," said Richard, 
20, a walk-on and former junior varsity coach at Marshall. "But I told the 
kids, 'Let's start now.' There's no reason to shine this year off." Pat 
Hernandez, who starts at third base, is the lone returning letterman, and he 
will be expected to anchor an infield of considerable inexperience. First 
baseman Stan Hessinger, second baseman Larry Gouger and shortstop Pat Eubanks 
all are sophomores. There are two sophomores in the outfield, Matt Ward and Ray 
Medina. Richard calls Ward, "the one to watch." Senior Jeff Martinez starts in 
left. The pitching staff, which Richard calls his main concern, consists of 
right-handed seniors Chad Runnels and Scott Boudreaux and junior right-hander 
John Bishop. "If we get the pitching taken care of, we'll be OK," Richard said.

OUTLOOK: Verdugo Hills played well in a scrimmage against Van Nuys on Tuesday, 
which made Richard feel a lot better about the big picture. "We've come a long, 
long way," he said. "I'm really impressed with the work ethic. Everybody has a 
great attitude." Richard has successfully cleared the first hurdle -- 
recruiting key young players from the student body. Whether the older players 
can contribute in uncertain; last season, the junior varsity did not win a 
game.
