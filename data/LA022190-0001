<P>
The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the government has wrongly denied monthly 
benefits and free medical care to poor disabled children by imposing stringent, 
unfair guidelines for eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could affect tens or even hundreds of thousands of low-income 
handicapped children denied Social Security benefits over the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The high court ordered federal officials to individually evaluate children to 
see if they are disabled rather than rely on a list of disabling conditions, as 
they have done since 1974, when children were first made eligible for the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Although children could qualify for benefits even if their disabilities were 
not on the list, they were less likely to receive benefits if the impairments 
were not specifically mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
The government list includes dozens of afflictions, including cerebral palsy, 
epilepsy and acute leukemia, but it does not include such well-known childhood 
impairments as spina bifida, Down's syndrome, muscular dystrophy, autism, AIDS 
and fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit was filed on behalf of 11-year-old Brian Zebley, who 
suffered brain damage at birth. He has eye problems, motor skills difficulties, 
is partly paralyzed and retarded. He received benefits for two years, until 
surgery enabled him to walk better. But in 1982 his benefits were cut off 
because he "no longer met or equaled the requirements" set forth in the 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"This program has been illegally administered for over 15 years," said Jonathan 
Stein, a Philadelphia lawyer who in 1983 filed the class-action suit that 
resulted in Tuesday's ruling. "This will open up benefits and free medical care 
to tens of thousands, and maybe hundreds of thousands, of poor kids who are 
disabled." 
</P>
<P>
The $12-billion-a-year Supplemental Security Income program provides extra 
income for poor persons who are over 65, blind or disabled. Beginning in 1974, 
Conbgress made poor disabled children eligible for the same benefits as adults 
if their mental or physical impairments were of "comparable severity" to a 
disability that would prevent an adult from "any substantial gainful activity." 
</P>
<P>
In response, federal regulators drew up a list of disabling impairments but 
ignored a number that are common only among children, the high court noted. In 
addition, the regulations made it easier for adults to qualify because, even 
without an impairment that was totally disabling, an adult could still show 
that he or she could not hold a job. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, Social Security officials have rejected about half of the average 
100,000 claims filed on behalf of children. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for a 7-2 majority, said that the 
government's "approach to child disability is manifestly contrary to the 
statute" enacted by Congress and is therefore illegal. Only Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White sided with government attorneys 
in the case (Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, vs. Zebley, 
88-1377). 
</P>
<P>
Neither lawyers involved in the case nor Social Security officials could 
estimate how much the ruling will cost the government. This year, about 265,000 
children are getting benefits under the program at an annual cost of nearly $1 
billion, Social Security officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have estimated that as many as 1 million children nationwide are 
impaired and living in low-income families, suggesting a greatly increased 
government liability. Social Security officials concede that some severely 
disabled children have fallen through the cracks but contend that there has 
been no wholesale denial of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The court did not specify whether the government must reopen claims from 
previous years. Because the nationwide class-action suit was filed in 1983, 
Justice Department lawyers conceded that they would have to reopen claims 
denied since then. But Stein, the Philadelphia attorney, said that he would 
seek to have claims reopened back to 1974, when the program began. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Holle, a child advocacy attorney with Protection and Advocacy Inc. in 
Glendale, Calif., said that the rigid federal regulations have discouraged many 
parents with disabled children from applying for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules were so restrictive and rigid that a lot of parents decided it was 
futile. It was particularly bad for infants and toddlers because their 
conditions often did not fit the list," Holle said. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the program provides a maximum monthly benefit of $499 for a 
disabled child. More important, children who qualify become eligible for 
Medicaid or MediCal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
A couple with a single disabled child may have a monthly income as high as 
$1,762 and still qualify for some benefits, Holle said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can apply for benefits at a local office of the Social Security 
Administration. "I also urge parents to talk to a social worker at the 
hospital, because they can help with the records," Holle said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a second ruling designed to protect children, the court said that 
parents suspected of abusing a child may be jailed for contempt if they refuse 
to obey a court order to disclose the child's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-2 ruling neatly disposes of a dilemma raised by a Baltimore mother's case 
but did so in an apparently narrow way. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Bouknight, a Baltimore woman whose young child, Maurice, had 
suffered broken bones and bruises in his first months of life, briefly lost 
custody of her child in 1986. But a juvenile court judge gave Bouknight custody 
again on the promise that she would improve her behavior and allow regular 
visits by child-care workers. 
</P>
<P>
She did neither, and in 1987 the child was reported missing by child-care 
workers, who suspected he was dead. But, when brought back before the judge, 
Bouknight invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and 
refused to disclose the whereabouts of Maurice. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said that Bouknight may not 
invoke the Fifth Amendment because she was under a juvenile court order. This 
was primarily a civil regulatory matter, not a criminal one, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the court has adopted this approach to narrow the reach of the 
Fourth and Fifth amendments. For example, officials may search persons at 
airports or at the U.S. borders without search warrants, the court has said, 
because these are primarily regulatory searches, not criminal ones. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the court has said that corporate officers may not invoke the Fifth 
Amendment and refuse to turn over potentially incriminating documents, again 
because this is considered a regulatory matter. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the court upheld a California law requiring motorists involved in 
accidents to supply their names and addresses, even if this information could 
prove incriminating. 
</P>
<P>
Citing these rulings, O'Connor described the juvenile courts as a "broadly 
directed, noncriminal regulatory regime" designed to protect children, not 
prosecute crimes. But O'Connor added that Bouknight, who has remained in a 
Baltimore jail, could seek immunity from prosecution for whatever information 
she provides. Maurice was last reported seen nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. said that 
forcing a suspect to disclose the whereabouts of a dead body certainly could 
prove incriminating and, therefore, should be covered by the Fifth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ruling in the case (Baltimore vs. Bouknight, 88-1182) has no effect 
on the much publicized two-year-long jailing of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan in the 
District of Columbia. Morgan hid her daughter rather than allow court-ordered 
visitations with the father. Morgan alleged that the father had sexually abused 
the child. She was held in jail on civil contempt charges and could not invoke 
the Fifth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand an appeals court ruling that government social workers are immune 
from suit for placing children in foster homes. Three children who were placed 
with an uncle in Washington state and were later sexually abused filed suit 
against the caseworker. But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San 
Francisco said these workers, like court employees, are immune from liability 
for their official actions if the child-placement decisions are approved by a 
court (Babcock vs. Tyler, 89-912). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dismissed a damage suit against the federal government filed by the widow 
of Navy Capt. Michael J. Smith, one of seven crew members who died in the 1986 
explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the other six, all civilians, accepted settlements from the 
government. But Smith's widow was not made a similar offer because, under a 
court doctrine that is still the subject of dispute, civilians may sue the 
government for damages but servicemen and their survivors may not. The claim by 
Smith's widow, Jane, was rejected by two lower courts, and the justices refused 
to reopen the issue (Smith vs. U.S., 89-607). 
</P>
<P>
POLICE POWER BOLSTERED -- The high court upheld a ruling that allows police to 
stop and question a person. A3
