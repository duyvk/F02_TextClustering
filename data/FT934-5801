Will he or won't he? All week I have been in a state of trepidation,
wondering whether Kenneth Clarke Ha Ha Ha, Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer, will dare to introduce value added tax on books and newspapers -
the so-called tax on knowledge - in Tuesday's Budget. I do not have a
surplus of knowledge, anyway, and the prospect that its acquisition may be
taxed has filled me with dismay.
In a flurry of desperation I have been reading book after book - one of
which, called Making of the Modern World, about milestones in science, has
had a strange effect, calming and pacifying me in a way I would not have
thought possible for someone whose normal state of mind as he surveys this
weary planet is one of melancholy.
Making of the Modern World was produced by experts at the Science Museum in
London, and lists 100 key developments in science, technology and medicine.
The photography is superb.
According to John Murray, the publisher, the inventions are presented
chronologically to give an idea of the historical progress made in science,
starting with the Byzantine sundial calendar in 1217 AD through to
genetically engineered mice in the 1980s. Other inventions covered include
Arkwright's spinning machine, Trevithick's high-pressure engine, Elias
Howe's sewing machine, Puffing Billy, the first plastic, Bell's telephone,
early cine cameras, the first tube railway, polythene, the V2 rocket, and
Marconi's first radio transmitter.
Before plunging in, I jotted down a short list of scientific breakthroughs I
would like to see. I did not ponder deeply. The idea was to improvise, at
speed, a list of obvious improvements on the life we live now and see how it
compared with the 100 key inventions listed in the book.
My list: a cure for cancer, and for all forms of illness; an anti-stupid
pill; super-cheap power; a gun that never hits its target; improved human
life expectancy; a way to save the elephant and all God's creatures.
It is not a brilliant list. It is amazingly airy-fairy. Even I can see that
now. But what I hadn't expected was the overwhelming practicality of the 100
key inventions listed by the museum. Most of these gadgets and processes
were the result of centuries' worth of effort aimed at answering extremely
specific needs.
None is airy-fairy, or was day-dreamed into existence. All are tangible and
real. As the Science Museum says, reflecting on these inventions helps us
appreciate why the world of today has become what it has.
An example is Bell's mechanical reaper, designed in 1827 by Patrick Bell of
Carmyllie, Scotland. For centuries, reaping (the cutting of corn at harvest)
had been done using hand-held sickles and scythes, even though a mechanical
reaper had been described in the writings of scholars of ancient Rome.
Bell's reaper proved to be the first workable design. He was ignorant of
previous research, except that of James Smith, and dismissed a succession of
ideas until starting work on a design incorporating the cutting action of
garden shears. A small working model was made in 1827, followed by a
full-scale prototype.
It is not in the least difficult to see how Bell's invention has played its
role in shaping the modern world - or to realise that without it the
European Union, among other ingenious things, would hardly have come into
existence. No Bell's reaper: no Jacques Delors. No Jacques Delors:
pestilence, war and famine across the face of Europe.
Similar trains of thought are produced by contemplating Lister's 1826
microscope, Bessemer's converter, Holmes' lighthouse generator, Crookes'
radiometer, Wimshurst's electrostatic machine, the Rover safety bicycle,
etc.
I am grateful to the Science Museum for helping me see why the world of
today has become what it has. There is a reason for everything. Whimsicality
is useless. An anti-stupid pill (given freely with The Sun) is probably
nothing but wishful thinking.
Thanks to this book, I have grown tolerant and fond of all sorts of modern
phenomena. Motorway service stations. British Rail. Eurotunnel and Euro
Disney. John Major. Prince Charles. Britain's nuclear submarines. Alleged
manifestations of the Virgin Mary. Vong Phaophanit's Neon Rice Field.
How long will this mood last? At least until Tuesday's Budget.
